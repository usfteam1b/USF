In this study, we investigated the presence of kidney damage markers and their predictive value for survival among hospitalized subjects with COVID-19. METHODS: Forty-seven participants was included and grouped as: 'COVID-19 patients before treatment', 'COVID-19 patients after treatment', 'COVID-19 patients under treatment in intensive care unit (ICU)', and 'controls'. Kidney function tests and several kidney injury biomarkers were compared between the groups. Cumulative rates of death from COVID-19 were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. The associations between covariates including kidney injury markers and death from COVID-19 were examined, as well. RESULTS: Serum creatinine and cystatin C levels, urine Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (KIM-1)/creatinine ratio, and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI), CKD-EPI cystatin C, and CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C levels demonstrated significant difference among the groups. The most significant difference was noted between the groups 'COVID-19 patients before treatment' and 'COVID-19 patients under treatment in ICU'. Advancing age, proteinuria, elevated serum cystatin C, and urine KIM-1/creatinine ratio were all significant univariate correlates of death (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05, for all). However, only elevated urine KIM-1/creatinine ratio retained significance in an age, sex, and comorbidities adjusted multivariable Cox regression (OR 6.11; 95% CI: 1.22-30.53; pâ€‰=â€‰0.02), whereas serum cystatin C showing only a statistically non-significant trend (OR 1.42; 95% CI: 0.00-2.52; pâ€‰=â€‰0.09).

With the deterioration of renal function, a certain proportion of CKD patients enter the uremic stage, and secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) becomes a challenge. For refractory hyperparathyroidism, parathyroidectomy (PTX) plays a key role in reducing mortality and improving prognosis. Nevertheless, no consensus has been reached on the optimal surgical method. We aimed to provide evidence for the effectiveness of surgical treatment by summarizing the experience from our center. METHODS: Clinical data from 1500 patients undergoing parathyroidectomy were recorded, which included 1419 patients in a total parathyroidectomy without autotransplantation (tPTX) group, 54 patients in a total parathyroidectomy plus autotransplantation (tPTXâ€‰+â€‰AT) group, and 27 patients in the other group. Perioperative basic data, intact parathyroid hormone (i-PTH) levels, serum calcium levels, serum phosphorus levels, pathological reports, coexisting thyroid diseases, short-term outcomes and complications were analyzed. Moreover, postoperative complications were compared between the tPTX and tPTXâ€‰+â€‰AT groups. RESULTS: Parathyroid hormone, serum calcium and phosphorus levels decreased significantly post-surgery. Two patients died during the perioperative period. As the two most common complications, the incidences of severe hypocalcemia and hyperkalemia were 36.20% (543 cases) and 24.60% (369 cases), respectively. Pre-iPTH levels (OR = 1.001, 95% CI: 1.001-1.001, pâ€‰<â€‰0.01), serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels (OR = 1.002, 95% CI: 1.001-1.002, pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) and the mass of excised parathyroid gland (OR = 3.06, 95% CI: 1.24-7.55, pâ€‰=â€‰0.02) were positively associated with postoperative severe hypocalcemia, while age and serum calcium were negatively associated with it. Pathological reports of resected parathyroid and thyroid glands indicated that 96.49% had parathyroid nodular hyperplasia, 13.45% had thyroid nodular hyperplasia, and 4.08% had thyroid papillary carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Parathyroidectomy is a safe and effective treatment for refractory secondary hyperparathyroidism.

In this study, we aimed to identify the rates and predictors for 30-day readmissions of Clostridiodes difficile Enterocolitis (CDE) in the United States. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of the Nationwide Readmissions Database to identify adult hospitalizations with a principal diagnosis of CDE for 2018. Individuals <18â€‰years old and elective hospitalizations were excluded. Primary outcomes included readmission rate and the top ten principal diagnosis on readmission, while the secondary outcomes were inpatient mortality, hospital costs and independent predictors of 30-day all-cause readmissions. Furthermore, we devised a scoring system to estimate the risk of CDE readmissions. StataÂ® Version 16 was used for statistical analysis and p-values â‰¤0.05 were statistically significant. RESULTS: We identified 94,668 index hospitalizations and 18,296 readmissions at 30-days for CDE in 2018. The 30-day all-cause readmission rate was 25.7%. On readmission, CDE was the most common principal diagnosis (25.7%), followed by unspecified sepsis, and acute renal failure. A female predominance was also noted for index and 30-day readmissions of CDE. Compared to index admissions, we noted higher odds of inpatient mortality [4.4 vs 1.4%, Odds Ratio (OR):3.32, 95% Confidence Interval (CI):2.87-3.84, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001], longer mean length of stay (LOS) [6.4 vs 5.6â€‰days, Mean Difference (MD):0.9, 95% CI:0.7-1.0, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and higher mean total hospital charge (THC) [$56,015 vs $40,871, MD:15,144, 95% CI:13,260-17,027, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001] for 30-day readmissions of CDE.

Data regarding the determinants, management, and outcomes of these patients are scarce. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the management, outcomes, and time-dependent changes of ACS patients without RFs. METHODS: Evaluation of clinical characteristics, management strategies, and outcomes as well as time-dependent changes [by 3 time periods: early (2000-2006), mid (2008-2013), and late (2016-2018)] of ACS patients without RFs (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, family history of ischemic heart disease, and smoking) or known coronary artery disease, enrolled in the biennial ACS Israeli Surveys (ACSIS) between 2000 and 2018. We compared ACS patients without RFs (no-RF group) to those with â‰¥1 RFs (RF group). RESULTS: Overall, 554/9,683 (5.7%) eligible ACS patients did not have any RFs [median age 63 (IQR 52-76) years, 25% females]. The no-RF group were older, with lower body mass index and prevalence of other cardiovascular comorbidity and chronic kidney disease compared with the RF group. The in-hospital percutaneous coronary intervention rates were lower among the no-RF vs. the RF group (55% vs. 66%, respectively p<0.001). Furthermore, lower rate of guideline-recommended medical therapy upon discharge was prescribed in the no-RF group. The rate of in-hospital complications was greater in the no-RF vs. RF group (31.6% vs. 26.1%, respectively p=0.005). The rates of 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; 17.6% vs.12.8%, respectively, p=0.002) and of 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality (8.4% vs. 4.2%, p<0.001 and 11.4% vs. 7.7%, p=0.003 respectively) were higher among patients with no-RF vs. RF. Following propensity score matching 30-day MACE, 30-day and 1-year mortality risk remained higher in the no-RF group. The rate of 30-day MACE decreased between the early and the late study period in the no-RF group (21.5% vs. 10.5%, p=0.003, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: ACS patients without traditional cardiovascular risk-factors comprise a unique group with reduced prevalence of comorbidities yet significantly worse outcomes.

Acute kidney Disease (AKD) was defined as elevated serum creatinine (sCR) levels before and up to 3â€‰months after chemotherapy. Morbidities, type of tumor, and treatment data were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 212 patients aged 55.5â€‰Â±â€‰14.0â€‰years were evaluated. Among the comorbidities, 30% had arterial hypertension (AH) and 11% had diabetes, and 18% were treated with CDDP, 41% with CARBO, and 41% with OXA. There was no difference in sCR levels before and after chemotherapy regardless of the chemotherapy used. The prevalence of eGFRs <60â€‰mL/min after chemotherapy was higher in patients with AH and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The incidence of post-chemotherapy AKD was 7.0% (nÂ =Â 13) and the mortality rate was 38.2%. Survival was lower in patients with AKD (PÂ =Â .012). CONCLUSIONS: There was a low incidence of AKD among the patients regardless of the chemotherapy used, but the patients with AKD had shorter survival. In addition, the reduction in eGFR after chemotherapy was greater in patients with AH and CVD.",2022/01/18 06:01,HSR2479 [pii] and 10.1002/hsr2.479 [doi],35036578,101728855,NA,10.1002/hsr2.479 [doi] and e479,cancer and carboplatin and chemotherapy and cisplatin and nephrotoxicity and oxaliplatin,NOTNLM,NA,NLM,NA,NA,PMC8753493,NA,The authors declare that they have no competing interests.,20220112,Â© 2022 The Authors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search was performed in September 2020. Comparative studies were evaluated according to Cochrane collaboration recommendations. Assessed long-term (>1-year postoperative) outcomes included chronic kidney disease, hypertension and glomerular filtration rate, among others. Odds ratio and mean difference with 95% confidence interval were extrapolated from available data for quantitative synthesis. Random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed according to study design and techniques. The systematic review was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020205378). RESULTS: A total of 23 studies describing 293 cases of unilateral WT and 386 cases of bilateral WT were included in the qualitative synthesis. Overall effect estimates demonstrate that patients undergoing RN have significantly increased odds of developing abnormal kidney function (OR 4.29, 95% CI 1.02, 18.00) and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate at long-term followup (mean difference -8.99, 95% CI -16.40, -1.58) compared to those undergoing NSS. In bilateral WT, patients undergoing RN with contralateral NSS have higher odds of developing abnormal kidney function (OR 3.82, 95% CI 1.76, 8.33) and hypertension (OR 5.81, 95% CI 1.31, 25.68) compared to bilateral NSS. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence is low quality but suggests that NSS for unilateral and bilateral WT may be associated with better kidney function or blood pressure at late followup.

This is usually associated with iron deficiency, inflammation and blood loss. However, little is known about the prevalence of anemia and its predictors among chronic kidney disease patients in Southern Ethiopia. This study aimed to determine anemia and its predictors among adult non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients in Southern Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 384 chronic kidney disease patients from February to April 2019. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected using questionnaires and medical records. Adjusted hemoglobin was taken to define anemia using the level of Hgb <13â€‰mg/dL for males and <12â€‰mg/dL for females; and blood films and serum ferritin were done for anemic participants. SPSS version 25.0 was used for data analysis. Frequency distribution tables and graphs were used to describe descriptive statistics. A bivariate logistic regression model was used to determine the predictors; p <.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Overall prevalence of anemia was 44.0% (95% CI: 39.0%, 48.9%); of which 7.1%, 62.1% and 30.8% of anemic patients had mild, moderate and severe anemia, respectively. The prevalence of anemia increased from 20.6% in stage 2 to 100% in stage 5. Morphologically, normocytic normochromic anemia was the most predominant type. Cardiovascular disease (AOR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.35, 4.16), diabetes mellitus (AOR = 2.77, 95% CI: 1.08, 7.14), stage 3b chronic kidney disease (AOR = 2.74, 95% CI: 1.31, 5.73) and stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease patients (AOR = 7.11, 95% CI: 3.22, 15.72) showed significant association with anemia.

Whether a similar delay in transplant age has occurred in the United States for Alport patients across all racial/ethnic groups is unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) to identify 3,794 Alport patients transplanted between 12/1987 and 12/2017. We divided the study period into five equal eras to assess temporal trends in age at transplant, graft survival, and patient survival across racial groups using linear regression and Cox regression models. RESULTS: The mean age at transplant for Blacks (28.3 years; difference (Black vs. White): 8.9 years; p < 0.0001) and Hispanics (28.7 years; difference (Hispanics vs. White): 8.7 years; p <Â 0.0001) was significantly younger compared with that of Whites.

Our objective was to evaluate the prevalence of AKI among hospitalized COVID-19-positive patients in a large hospital system in the Southeast of the USA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cohort study of admitted patients discharged between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020 at Atrium Health who had tested positive for COVID-19 by polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal swab. The positive test had been within 2 weeks prior to or after admission. AKI was defined and staged using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2012 AKI criteria. Patient-level data including demographic characteristics, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and other comorbidities were also obtained. RESULTS: Of the admitted patients with COVID-19, 74 of 254 (29.1%, 95% CI 23.6 - 35.1%) had AKI.

Epub 2021 and Sep 25.,204,1096-0953 (Electronic) and 0013-9351 (Linking) and Pt B,112127,"BACKGROUND: Typical thermoregulatory responses to elevated temperatures among healthy individuals include reduced blood pressure and perspiration. Individuals with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are susceptible to systemic fluctuations caused by ambient temperature changes that may increase morbidity and mortality. We investigated whether pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure (preSBP) and interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) can independently mediate the association between ambient temperature, all-cause hospital admissions (ACHA), and all-cause mortality (ACM). METHODS: The study population consisted of ESKD patients receiving hemodialysis treatments at Fresenius Medical Care facilities in Philadelphia County, PA, from 2011 to 2019 (nÂ =Â 1981). Within a time-to-event framework, we estimated the association between daily maximum dry-bulb temperature (TMAX) and, as separate models, ACHA and ACM during warmer calendar months. Clinically measured preSBP and IDWG responses to temperature increases were estimated using linear mixed effect models. We employed the difference (c-c') method to decompose total effect models for ACHA and ACM using preSBP and IDWG as time-dependent mediators. Covariate adjustments for exposure-mediator and total and direct effect models include age, race, ethnicity, blood pressure medication use, treatment location, preSBP, and IDWG. We considered lags up to two days for exposure and 1-day lag for mediator variables (Lag 2-Lag 1) to assure temporality between exposure-outcome models. Sensitivity analyses for 2-day (Lag 2-only) and 1-day (Lag 1-only) lag structures were also conducted. RESULTS: Based on Lag 2- Lag 1 temporal ordering, 1Â Â°C increase in daily TMAX was associated with increased hazard of ACHA by 1.4% (adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 1.014; 95% confidence interval, 1.007-1.021) and ACM 7.5% (adjusted HR, 1.075, 1.050-1.100). Short-term lag exposures to 1Â Â°C increase in temperature predicted mean reductions in IDWG and preSBP by 0.013-0.015% and 0.168-0.229Â mmHg, respectively. Mediation analysis for ACHA identified significant indirect effects for all three studied pathways (preSBP, IDWG, and preSBPÂ +Â IDWG) and significant indirect effects for IDWG and conjoined preSBPÂ +Â IDWG pathways for ACM. Of note, only 1.03% of the association between temperature and ACM was mediated through preSBP. The mechanistic path for IDWG, independent of preSBP, demonstrated inconsistent mediation and, consequently, potential suppression effects in ACHA (-15.5%) and ACM (-6.3%) based on combined pathway models. Proportion mediated estimates from preSBPÂ +Â IDWG pathways achieved 2.2% and 0.3% in combined pathway analysis for ACHA and ACM outcomes, respectively. Lag 2 discrete-time ACM mediation models exhibited consistent mediation for all three pathways suggesting that 2-day lag in IDWG and preSBP responses can explain 2.11% and 4.41% of total effect association between temperature and mortality, respectively. CONCLUSION: We corroborated the previously reported association between ambient temperature, ACHA and ACM. Our results foster the understanding of potential physiological linkages that may explain or suppress temperature-driven hospital admissions and mortality risks. Of note, concomitant changes in preSBP and IDWG may have little intermediary effect when analyzed in combined pathway models. These findings advance our assessment of candidate interventions to reduce the impact of outdoor temperature change on ESKD patients.",2022/01/27 06:00,S0013-9351(21)01428-6 [pii] and 10.1016/j.envres.2021.112127 [doi],34582801,0147621,Netherlands,S0013-9351(21)01428-6 [pii] and 10.1016/j.envres.2021.112127 [doi],*Blood pressure and *Dry-bulb temperature and *End-stage kidney disease and *Inter-dialytic weight gain and *Mediation analysis and *Suppression effects,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,20220124,"Hospitalization and Hospitals and Humans and *Kidney Failure, Chronic/therapy and *Renal Dialysis and Temperature",NA,NA,NA,20210925,Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Inc.

We examined the humoral responses to the Sinopharm COVID vaccine in haemodialysis patients. METHODS: Standard vaccinations (two doses at interval of ~21â€‰days) were given to all consenting haemodialysis patients on dialysis (nÂ =Â 1296). We measured the antibody responses at 14-21â€‰days after the second vaccine to define the development of anti-spike antibodies >15â€‰AU/ml after vaccination and observed the clinical effects of vaccination. RESULTS: Vaccination was very well tolerated with few side-effects. In those who consented to antibody measurements, (nÂ =Â 446) baseline sampling showed 77 had positive antibodies, yet received full vaccination without any apparent adverse events. Positive anti-spike antibodies developed in 50% of the 270 baseline negative patients who had full sampling, compared with 78.1% in the general population. COVID infection continues to occur in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, but in the whole group vaccination appears to have been associated with a reduction in the case fatality rate. CONCLUSION: The humoral immune responses to standard HB02 vaccination schedules are attenuated in a haemodialysis cohort, but likely the vaccine saves lives.

The relationship between PEW and long-term development of clinically important outcomes remains to be examined. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationships between PEW, as measured by Subjective Global Assessment (SGA 1-7), and progression to important clinical outcomes: mortality and/or kidney failure. DESIGN: Prospective cohort design. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and thirty-nine participants wereÂ well-nourished and 37 moderately malnourished patients with CKD 3-5. MEASUREMENTS: The outcomes were 2, 5, and 10-year progression to kidney failure (dialysis or transplant) or mortality, kidney failure alone, and mortality alone. SGA was determined by a registered renal dietitian. Food frequency questionnaires were used to assess dietary intake. Clinical and laboratory baseline characteristics were collected. Multivariable regression models and Cox models were created to examine the relationship between SGA and outcomes. RESULTS: PEW was associated with the combined outcome of kidney failure or mortality at 2 (pâ€‰=â€‰0.003), 5 (pâ€‰=â€‰0.004), but not at 10 (pâ€‰=â€‰0.73) years. This relationship was primarily driven by the relationship between PEW and kidney failure. In Cox models, the relationship between PEW and kidney failure remained after adjusting for Kidney Failure Risk Equation scores. The multivariable modeling revealed that PEW remained a statistically significant predictor of the combined outcome and ESKD after adjustment for age, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), sex, albumin-to-creatinine ratio, diabetes, albumin, and protein intake. CONCLUSIONS: PEW, determined by the SGA 1-7, is an important prognostic tool. Further research looking at clinically important outcomes are needed to implement nutritional interventions for nondialysis-dependent CKD patients.",2022/02/15 06:00,10.1111/jorc.12378 [doi],34053197,101392167,United States,10.1111/jorc.12378 [doi],chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease and mortality and protein energy wasting and subjective global assessment,NOTNLM,NA,NLM,20220214,"Cachexia and Humans and *Kidney Failure, Chronic and Nutritional Status and Prospective Studies and *Protein-Energy Malnutrition/etiology and Renal Dialysis and *Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/complications",NA,NA,NA,20210530,Â© 2021 European Dialysis and Transplant Nurses Association/European Renal Care and Association.,Kidney Foundation of Canada/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous studies have been insufficiently powered to address whether MAR confers long-term benefit over SAR in patients with renal dysfunction who require CABG. METHODS: We conducted retrospective cohort study in Ontario, Canada of patients who underwent isolated CABG (n = 23,406). The primary outcome was MACE, defined as the composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization. We compared patients by matching them on the propensity to have received SAR versus MAR, within groups with preoperative glomerular filtration rate (GFR) â‰¥60â€ŠmL/min/1.73â€Šm2; GFR between 30 and 60; and GFR <30. RESULTS: In patients with GFR â‰¥60, the use of MAR versus SAR was associated with a lower rate of MACE [hazard ratio (HR) 0.87 (0.80-0.94)], and a lower rate of long-term mortality [HR 0.87 (0.79-0.97)]. In those with GFR between 30 and 60, MAR was not associated with a difference in MACE [HR 1.04 (0.87-1.26)], and a lower rate of long-term mortality [HR 0.75 (0.65-0.87)] was observed. In those with GFR <30, MAR was not associated with a difference in outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: MAR versus SAR does not correlate with a difference in MACE amongst patients with GFR between 30 and 60 and better survival raises the possibility of indication bias. Furthermore, MAR did not confer a benefit in those with severely reduced renal function. These data suggest that the potential long-term benefits of using MAR in CABG patients with renal insufficiency may be offset by competing health risks.",2020/06/27 06:00,00000658-202203000-00030 [pii] and 10.1097/SLA.0000000000003908 [doi],32590546,0372354,United States,10.1097/SLA.0000000000003908 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,20220217,Adult and Cohort Studies and Coronary Artery Bypass/*methods and Coronary Artery Disease/*complications/*surgery and Humans and Myocardial Infarction/epidemiology and Ontario and Postoperative Complications/epidemiology and Renal Insufficiency/*complications and Reoperation/statistics & numerical data and Retrospective Studies and Stroke/epidemiology and Time Factors and Treatment Outcome,NA,NA,The authors declare no conflict of interests.,NA,"Copyright Â© 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Less is known about whether the increased risk persists long-term or is independent of renal function and other important biomarkers. Methods and Results Cystatin C and other biomarkers were measured at baseline (in 7863 patients) and 1Â year later (in 6106 patients) in participants in the LIPID (Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease) study, who had a previous acute coronary syndrome. Outcomes were ascertained during the study (median follow-up, 6Â years) and long-term (median follow-up, 16Â years). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equations (first GFR-creatinine, then GFR-creatinine-cystatin C). Over 6Â years, in fully adjusted multivariable time-to-event models, with respect to the primary end point of coronary heart disease mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction, for comparison of Quartile 4 versus 1 of baseline cystatin C, the hazard ratio was 1.37 (95% CI, 1.07-1.74; P=0.01), and for major cardiovascular events was 1.47 (95% CI, 1.19-1.82; P<0.001). Over 16Â years, the association of baseline cystatin C with coronary heart disease, cardiovascular, and all-cause mortality persisted (each P<0.001) and remained significant after adjustment for estimated GFR-creatinine-cystatin C. Cystatin C also predicted the development of chronic kidney disease for 6Â years (odds ratio, 6.61; 95% CI, 4.28-10.20) independently of estimated GFR-creatinine and other risk factors. However, this association was no longer significant after adjustment for estimated GFR-creatinine-cystatin C. Conclusions Cystatin C independently predicted major cardiovascular events, development of chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Prediction of long-term mortality was independent of improved estimation of GFR.

OBJECTIVE: To compare precipitating factors, risk factors, investigations, management and outcomes for T2MI and T1MI. DATA SOURCES: Medline and Embase databases as well as reference list of recent articles were searched January 2009 to December 2020 for term 'type 2 myocardial infarction'. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they used a universal definition of MI and reported quantitative data on at least one variable of interest. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were pooled using random-effect meta-analysis. Risk of bias was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment tool. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines were followed. All review stages were conducted by two reviewers. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risk factors, presenting symptoms, cardiac investigations such as troponin and angiogram, management and outcomes such as mortality. RESULTS: 40 cohort studies comprising 98 930 patients with T1MI and 13 803 patients with T2MI were included. Compared with T1MI, patients with T2MI were: more likely to have pre-existing chronic kidney disease (OR 1.87; 95% CI 1.53 to 2.28) and chronic heart failure (OR 2.35; 95% CI 1.82 to 3.03), less likely to present with typical cardiac symptoms of chest pain (OR 0.19; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.26) and more likely to present with dyspnoea (OR 2.64; 95% CI 1.86 to 3.74); more likely to demonstrate non-specific ST-T wave changes on ECG (OR 2.62; 95% CI 1.81 to 3.79) and less likely to show ST elevation (OR 0.22; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.28); less likely to undergo coronary angiography (OR 0.09; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.12) and percutaneous coronary intervention (OR 0.06; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.10) or receive cardioprotective medications, such as statins (OR 0.25; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.38) and beta-blockers (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.63).

METHODS: Articles providing data on the prevalence, treatment or outcomes of Helicobacter pylori-negative gastritis were identified through a systematic search in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. All original research articles from human studies until October 31st, 2021, were included. RESULTS: A total of 54 studies were included consisted of eosinophilic gastritis (nâ€Š=â€Š9), autoimmune gastritis (nâ€Š=â€Š11), collagenous gastritis (nâ€Š=â€Š16), focally enhanced gastritis (nâ€Š=â€Š6), lymphocytic gastritis (nâ€Š=â€Š5) and other causes including idiopathic gastritis and chronic renal failure related (nâ€Š=â€Š7). Most of the included studies were either cross-sectional or longitudinal cohorts except for collagenous gastritis which mainly included case-reports and case-series. The prevalence of paediatric eosinophilic gastritis ranges between 5-7/100,000 and patients have generally favourable outcome with 50% to 70% clinical and histological response to either corticosteroids or elimination diets. Autoimmune gastritis and collagenous gastritis are extremely rare entities, commonly present with refractory iron deficiency anaemia, while lymphocytic gastritis is relatively common (10%-45%) in children with coeliac disease. Data on treatments and outcomes of autoimmune, collagenous and focally enhanced gastritis are lacking with limited data implying poor response to therapy in the former two diagnoses.

characteristics associated with more severe outcomes in a global registry of people with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and COVID-19. METHODS: People with SLE and COVID-19 reported in the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance registry from March 2020 to June 2021 were included. The ordinal outcome was defined as: (1) not hospitalised, (2) hospitalised with no oxygenation, (3) hospitalised with any ventilation or oxygenation and (4) death. A multivariable ordinal logistic regression model was constructed to assess the relationship between COVID-19 severity and demographic characteristics, comorbidities, medications and disease activity. RESULTS: A total of 1606 people with SLE were included. In the multivariable model, older age (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.04), male sex (1.50, 1.01 to 2.23), prednisone dose (1-5â€‰mg/day 1.86, 1.20 to 2.66, 6-9â€‰mg/day 2.47, 1.24 to 4.86 and â‰¥10 mg/day 1.95, 1.27 to 2.99), no current treatment (1.80, 1.17 to 2.75), comorbidities (eg, kidney disease 3.51, 2.42 to 5.09, cardiovascular disease/hypertension 1.69, 1.25 to 2.29) and moderate or high SLE disease activity (vs remission; 1.61, 1.02 to 2.54 and 3.94, 2.11 to 7.34, respectively) were associated with more severe outcomes. In age-adjusted and sex-adjusted models, mycophenolate, rituximab and cyclophosphamide were associated with worse outcomes compared with hydroxychloroquine; outcomes were more favourable with methotrexate and belimumab. CONCLUSIONS: More severe COVID-19 outcomes in individuals with SLE are largely driven by demographic factors, comorbidities and untreated or active SLE. Patients using glucocorticoids also experienced more severe outcomes.",2022/02/18 06:00,annrheumdis-2021-221636 [pii] and 10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-221636 [doi],35172961,0372355,England,annrheumdis-2021-221636 [pii] and 10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-221636 [doi],COVID-19 and epidemiology and lupus erythematosus and systemic,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Competing interests: MFU-G has received research grants from Pfizer and Janssen, not and related to this manuscript.

Statin intolerance remains an important clinical challenge, and it is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. This meta-analysis estimates the overall prevalence of SI, the prevalence according to different diagnostic criteria and in different disease settings, and identifies possible risk factors/conditions that might increase the risk of SI. METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched several databases up to 31 May 2021, for studies that reported the prevalence of SI. The primary endpoint was overall prevalence and prevalence according to a range of diagnostic criteria [National Lipid Association (NLA), International Lipid Expert Panel (ILEP), and European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS)] and in different disease settings. The secondary endpoint was to identify possible risk factors for SI. A random-effects model was applied to estimate the overall pooled prevalence. A total of 176 studies [112 randomized controlled trials (RCTs); 64 cohort studies] with 4â€‰143â€‰517 patients were ultimately included in the analysis. The overall prevalence of SI was 9.1% (95% confidence interval 8.0-10%). The prevalence was similar when defined using NLA, ILEP, and EAS criteria [7.0% (6.0-8.0%), 6.7% (5.0-8.0%), 5.9% (4.0-7.0%), respectively]. The prevalence of SI in RCTs was significantly lower compared with cohort studies [4.9% (4.0-6.0%) vs. 17% (14-19%)]. The prevalence of SI in studies including both primary and secondary prevention patients was much higher than when primary or secondary prevention patients were analysed separately [18% (14-21%), 8.2% (6.0-10%), 9.1% (6.0-11%), respectively]. Statin lipid solubility did not affect the prevalence of SI [4.0% (2.0-5.0%) vs. 5.0% (4.0-6.0%)]. Age [odds ratio (OR) 1.33, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.04], female gender (OR 1.47, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.007), Asian and Black race (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 for both), obesity (OR 1.30, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.02), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.26, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.02), hypothyroidism (OR 1.37, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.01), chronic liver, and renal failure (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 for both) were significantly associated with SI in the meta-regression model. Antiarrhythmic agents, calcium channel blockers, alcohol use, and increased statin dose were also associated with a higher risk of SI. CONCLUSION: Based on the present analysis of >4 million patients, the prevalence of SI is low when diagnosed according to international definitions. These results support the concept that the prevalence of complete SI might often be overestimated and highlight the need for the careful assessment of patients with potential symptoms related to SI. KEY QUESTION: What is the overall prevalence of statin intolerance (SI) worldwide? What are the main risk factors of SI? KEY FINDING: The overall prevalence of SI is 9.1% and even lower using the international definitions: National Lipid Association, International Lipid Expert Panel, European Atherosclerosis Society (7.0, 6.7, 5.9%). Female gender, hypothyroidism, high statin dose, advanced age, antiarrhythmics, and obesity are the main factors that increase the risk of SI. TAKE-HOME MESSAGE: Clinicians should use these results to encourage adherence to statin therapy in the patients they treat.",2022/02/17 06:00,6529098 [pii] and 10.1093/eurheartj/ehac015 [doi],35169843,8006263,England,ehac015 [pii] and 10.1093/eurheartj/ehac015 [doi],Cardiovascular disease and Prevalence and Risk factors and Statin intolerance,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20220216,"Â© The Author(s) 2022.

Data regarding associations of arterial stiffness with health outcomes on longer-term follow-up are lacking. METHODS: We evaluated 7283 Framingham Study participants (mean age 50 years, 53% women) who underwent assessment of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (a marker of arterial stiffness) via applanation tonometry at one or more routine examinations. We used time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression models to relate carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity to the incidence of health outcomes (updating carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and all covariates at serial examinations). RESULTS: On long-term follow-up (median 15 years; minimum-maximum, 0-20), participants developed cardiometabolic disease (hypertension [1255 events]; diabetes [381 events]), chronic kidney disease (529 events), dementia (235 events), cardiovascular disease (684 events) and its components (coronary heart disease [314 events], heart failure [191 events], transient ischemic attacks or stroke [250 events]), and death (1086 events). In multivariable-adjusted models, each SD increment in carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity was associated with increased risk of hypertension (hazard ratio [HR], 1.32 [95% CI, 1.21-1.44]), diabetes (HR, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.11-1.58]), chronic kidney disease (1.19 [95% CI, 1.05-1.34]), dementia (HR 1.27 [95% CI, 1.06-1.53]), cardiovascular disease (HR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.06-1.36]) and its components (coronary heart disease, HR 1.37 [95% CI, 1.13-1.65]; transient ischemic attack/stroke, HR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.00-1.53]), and death (HR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.17-1.43]).

Despite the evidence behind the efficacy of orlistat in achieving weight loss in patients with obesity, no study thus far has quantified its long-term effect on cardiovascular outcomes. The purpose of this study is to explore long-term cardiovascular outcomes after orlistat therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: A propensity-score matched cohort study was conducted on the nation-wide electronic primary and integrated secondary healthcare records of the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). The 36Â 876 patients with obesity in the CPRD database who had completed a course of orlistat during follow-up were matched on a 1:1 basis with equal numbers of controls who had not taken orlistat. Patients were followed up for a median of 6â€‰years for the occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events (fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke), and a number of secondary endpoints including primary endpoint components individually, the occurrence of new-onset heart failure, coronary revascularization, new chronic kidney disease stage III+ (CKD3+), and all-cause mortality. During the median study follow-up of 6â€‰years, the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events was lower in the orlistat cohort [hazard ratio (HR) 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66-0.83, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001]. Patients who took orlistat experienced lower rates of myocardial infarction (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.66-0.88, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and ischaemic stroke (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.56 to -0.84, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) as well as new-onset heart failure (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.67-0.94, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.007). There was no differences in revascularization rates (HR 1.12; 95% CI 0.91-1.38, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.27), but a lower rate of both CKD3+ development (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.73-0.83, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and mortality (HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.36 to -0.41, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) was observed. CONCLUSION: In this nation-wide, propensity-score matched study, orlistat was associated with lower rates of overall major adverse cardiovascular events, new-onset heart failure, renal failure, and mortality. This study adds to current evidence on the known improvements in cardiovascular risk factor profiles of orlistat treatment by suggesting a potential role in primary prevention.",2021/05/16 06:00,6274862 [pii] and 10.1093/ehjcvp/pvaa133 [doi],33991094,101669491,England,10.1093/ehjcvp/pvaa133 [doi],Cardiovascular and Obesity and Orlistat and Weight loss and outcomes,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

Thus, patients with end-stage renal disease are routinely screened for CAD before renal transplantation. The usefulness of revascularization before transplantation remains unclear. We hypothesize that there is no difference in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in waitlisted renal transplant candidates with CAD who underwent revascularization versus those treated with optimal medical therapy before transplantation. Methods and Results This meta-analysis was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses guidelines. MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched to identify relevant studies. Risk of bias was assessed using the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome of interest was all-cause mortality. Eight studies comprising 945 patients were included (36% women, mean age 56 years). There was no difference in all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR], 1.16 [95% CI, 0.63-2.12), cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.29-1.89]), or major adverse cardiovascular events (RR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.30-2.07]) when comparing renal transplant candidates with CAD who underwent revascularization versus those who were on optimal medical therapy before renal transplant. Conclusions This meta-analysis demonstrates that revascularization is not superior to optimal medical therapy in reducing all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, or major adverse cardiovascular events in waitlisted kidney transplant candidates with CAD who eventually underwent kidney transplantation.",2022/02/09 06:00,10.1161/JAHA.121.023548 [doi],35132876,101580524,England,10.1161/JAHA.121.023548 [doi],coronary artery disease and coronary revascularization and medical therapy and renal transplantation,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20220208,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For this retrospective cohort analysis, we identified adult AMI survivors from January to June 2014 from the United States Nationwide Readmissions Database. Outcomes were a 6-month HF, fatal HF, composite of HF during the AMI or a 6-month HF, and a composite of 6-month HF or death during a non-HF-related admission. We analyzed differences in outcomes across categories of patients without renal injury, AKI without CKD, stable CKD, AKI on CKD, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Of 237,549 AMI survivors, AKI was present in 13.8%, CKD in 16.5%, ESRD in 3.4%, and AKI on CKD in 7.7%. Patients with renal failure had lower coronary revascularization rates and higher in-hospital HF. A 6-month HF hospitalization occurred in 12,934 patients (5.4%). Compared with patients without renal failure (3.3%), 6-month HF admission rate was higher in patients with AKI on CKD (14.6%; odds ratio [OR] 1.99; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.81 to 2.19), ESRD (11.2%; OR 1.57; 95% CI 1.36 to 1.81), stable CKD (10.7%; OR 1.72; 95% CI 1.56 to 1.88), and AKI (8.6%; OR 1.52; 95% CI 1.36 to 1.70). Results were generally homogenous in prespecified subgroups and for the other outcomes. In conclusion, 1 in 4 AMI survivors had either acute or chronic renal failure.

This study investigated the relation between the institutional CKD percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) volume and in-hospital clinical outcomes in patients with CKD. Among 1,199,901 patients who underwent PCI in 2014 to 2018 from the Japanese nationwide registry, we analyzed 220,509 patients with CKD. Patients were classified into quartiles (Q) according to the mean annual institutional CKD-PCI volume (Q1 <42 PCIs/year, Q2 <74 PCIs/year, Q3 <124 PCIs/year, Q4 â‰¥125 PCIs/year). The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital death and periprocedural complications. The mean age of patients was 73 Â± 10 years, and 36% (nÂ =Â 78,332) were on dialysis. PCI was more likely to be performed with rotational atherectomy devices in high-volume institutions. Contrast volume was lower, the rate of radial access PCI was higher, and door-to-balloon time (for ST-elevation myocardial infarction) was shorter in the highest quartile institutions. Primary outcomes were observed in 6,539 patients (3.0%). The crude rate of the primary outcome was lowest in institutions with the highest PCI volume (Q1 3.4%, Q2 3.0%, Q3 3.0%, Q4 2.4%, p <0.001); higher PCI volume was associated with reduced frequency of the primary outcome (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] relative to Q1:Q2, 0.89 [0.83 to 0.96]; Q3 0.90 [0.84 to 0.97]; and Q4 0.76 [0.84 to 0.97]).

The relevance of ID in patients in recovery after acute stroke is not known. We assessed the prevalence of ID and anaemia in relation to functional capacity and to recovery during early rehabilitation after stroke. METHODS: This observational study enrolled consecutively 746 patients with ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke at in-patient early rehabilitation (age 68Â Â±Â 13Â years, female 47%, ischaemic stroke 87%). Functional capacity was assessed before and after rehabilitation using Barthel index (reha-BI), motricity index (MI), trunk control test (TCT), and functional ambulatory category (FAC). ID was defined as ferritin <100Â Î¼g/L or as transferrin saturation (TSAT)Â <Â 20% if ferritin was 100-Â <Â 300Â Î¼g/L or if CrPÂ >Â 5Â mg/L. Anaemia was defined as HbÂ <Â 12Â g/dL (women) and <13Â g/dL (men). RESULTS: The prevalence of ID and anaemia before rehabilitation were 45% and 46%, respectively, and remained high at discharge (after 27Â Â±Â 17Â days) at 40% and 48%, respectively. Patients with ID had lower functional capacity compared with patients without ID (reha-BI 20 [Â±86] vs. 40 [Â±80], MI 64 [Â±66] vs. 77 [Â±41], TCT 61 [Â±76] vs. 100 [Â±39], FAC 1 [Â±4] vs. 4 [Â±4]; median [IQR], all P < 0.001). ID was related to inflammation (OR 2.68 [95% CI 1.98-3.63], PÂ <Â 0.001), female sex (OR 2.13 [95% CI 1.59-2.85], PÂ <Â 0.001), haemorrhagic stroke (OR 1.70 [95% CI 1.11-2.61], PÂ =Â 0.015), initial treatment on stroke unit (OR 3.59 [95% CI 1.08-11.89], PÂ <Â 0.001), and anaemia (OR 2.94 [95% CI 2.18-3.96], PÂ <Â 0.001), while age, BMI, and renal function were not related to ID. In adjusted analysis, ID was associated with low functional capacity in all functional scores: reha-BI (OR 1.66 [95% CI 1.08-2.54], PÂ =Â 0.02), motricity index (OR 1.94 [95% CI 1.36-2.76], PÂ <Â 0.001), trunk control test (OR 2.34 [95% CI] 1.64-3.32, PÂ <Â 0.001) and functional ambulatory category (OR 1.77 [95% CI 1.2-2.63], PÂ <Â 0.02). Functional capacity improved during rehabilitation regardless of presence of ID, but functional outcome remained significantly lower in patients with ID at the end of rehabilitation (rehab BI and MI, both PÂ <Â 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Iron deficiency and anaemia are common and persistent findings in patients after acute stroke. ID and anaemia are independently related to lower functional capacity after acute stroke and to poor functional outcome after rehabilitation.

These pregnancies are associated with significant risks of morbidity and mortality and propose a challenge to clinicians. The aim of this longitudinal cohort study is to prospectively record the incidence, prevalence, aetiology, outcomes and follow-up of maternal CKD and cardiac disease in the obstetric population of South Australia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a state-wide multicentre prospective cohort study in South Australia that will begin recruitment in 2022 and is planned for at least 5 years. Pregnant women with chronic or acquired kidney or cardiac disease will be enrolled across the state's major public obstetric hospitals. The data collected will focus on the chronic disease aetiology, peripartum interventions, delivery, obstetric and neonatal outcomes, progression of underlying disease and patient-related outcome measures. Women will have data collected each trimester during pregnancy and then at follow-up 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post partum. Clear inclusion and exclusion criteria have been developed which importantly includes new diagnosis of chronic disease in pregnancy. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approval was obtained from the local Health Network Human Research Ethics Committee. Summary data will be reviewed and reported in accordance with Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology criteria 6 monthly and results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences.

SETTING: A case-control study at a tertiary referral hospital in central Taiwan. PARTICIPANTS: We used an asthma cohort, which included 11â€‰400 patients with asthma, for the period 2006-2018 at Taichung Veterans General Hospital. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We identified patients who had admitted for exacerbation as cases and selected patients with asthma without exacerbation, matching (1:4) the cases for age, gender and season of exacerbation, as controls. Data on hourly level of air pollutants were obtained from the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration. We used conditional logistic regression and calculated adjusted ORs (adjORs) with 95% CIs. RESULTS: We enrolled 11â€‰400 participants with asthma, and 4.4% (501) of them had been admitted for exacerbation. Participants with asthma with exacerbation requiring hospitalisation were exposed to a higher level of O(3) 8-hour daily maximum (adjOR 1.009, 95% CI 1.001 to 1.016) and were more likely to have high Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI â‰¥3; adjOR 2.198, 95% CI 1.729 to 2.794) and asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap (adjOR 4.542, 95% CI 3.376 to 6.611) compared with those without exacerbation. The aforementioned associations between exacerbation of asthma requiring hospitalisation and exposure to O(3) were similar when defined by either O(3) 1-hour daily maximum or O(3) 24-hour average. Moreover, the O(3) relevant exacerbation of asthma mainly existed in those aged older than 65 years and patients with medical comorbidities, including gastrointestinal diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neurological diseases, diabetes and renal disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the need for vigilance of exposure to O(3) among elderly with asthma, particularly those with medical comorbidities.

This study aimed to characterize and describe the severity and outcomes of this event at a Portuguese hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis, by clinical record review, of all confirmed cases diagnosed in a hospital in the North of Portugal, between January 2013 and December 2018. We included those who were non-pregnant and at least 18 years old. RESULTS: Fifty-seven cases occurred, mostly in females and aged patients; 33.3% were healthcare facility-outset, while 31.6% were community-associated. Regarding severity, 43.9% had non-severe, while 29.8% severe and 21.0% fulminant presentations, the latter with the need of admission. Exposure to antibiotics occurred in 68.4%, while to proton-pump inhibitors in 57.9%. Risk factors for severe disease were female gender, chronic renal disease, and high neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio. Moreover, renal disease and a higher ratio were associated with fulminant disease. Thirty-day all-cause mortality was found in 15.8% while 90-day in 28.1%. Risk factors for 30-day mortality were renal disease, higher Charlson score, and higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio. Risk factors for 90-day mortality were advanced age, previous antibiotic exposure, higher Charlson score, and higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio.

immunomodulatory/suppressive medications may have higher risk of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Chronic disease care has also changed for many patients, with uncertain downstream consequences. METHODS: We included participants with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions followed by specialists at Johns Hopkins. Participants completed periodic surveys querying comorbidities, disease-modifying medications, exposures, COVID-19 testing and outcomes, social behaviors, and disruptions to healthcare. We assessed whether COVID-19 risk is higher among those on immunomodulating or suppressive agents and characterized pandemic-associated changes to care and mental health. RESULTS: In total, 265 (5.6%) developed COVID-19 over 9 months of follow-up (April-December 2020). Patient characteristics (age, race, comorbidity, medications) were associated with differences in social distancing behaviors during the pandemic. Glucocorticoid exposure was associated with higher odds of COVID-19 in models incorporating behavior and other potential confounders (odds ratio [OR]: 1.43; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08, 1.89). Other medication classes were not associated with COVID-19 risk. Diabetes (OR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.73), cardiovascular disease (OR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.24, 2.28), and kidney disease (OR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.04, 2.97) were associated with higher odds of COVID-19. Of the 2156 reporting pre-pandemic utilization of infusion, mental health or rehabilitative services, 975 (45.2%) reported disruptions therein, which disproportionately affected individuals experiencing changes to employment or income. CONCLUSIONS: Glucocorticoid exposure may increase risk of COVID-19 in people with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions. Disruption to healthcare and related services was common. Those with pandemic-related reduced income may be most vulnerable to care disruptions.",2022/02/17 06:00,6270948 [pii] and ciab407 [pii] and 10.1093/cid/ciab407 [doi],33956972,9203213,NA,10.1093/cid/ciab407 [doi],*COVID-19 and *autoimmune disease and *glucocorticoids and *immune-modulating medications,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,20220216,*Autoimmune Diseases/epidemiology and *COVID-19 and COVID-19 Testing and Humans and Pandemics and Risk Factors and SARS-CoV-2,PMC8135997,NA,NA,NA,"Â© The Author(s) 2021.

Some observational studies suggest that long-term use of PPIs is potentially associated with certain adverse kidney outcomes. We conducted a systematic literature review to assess potential bias in non-randomized studies reporting on putative associations between PPIs and adverse kidney outcomes (acute kidney injury, acute interstitial nephritis, chronic interstitial nephritis, acute tubular necrosis, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease). METHODS: We searched the medical literature within 10 years of 17 December 2020. Pre-specified criteria guided identification of relevant English language articles for assessment. Risk of bias on an outcome-specific basis was evaluated using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: Of 620 initially identified records, 26 studies met a priori eligibility criteria and underwent risk of bias assessment. Nineteen studies were judged as having a moderate risk of bias for reported adverse kidney outcomes, while six studies were judged as having a serious risk of bias (mainly due to inadequate control of confounders and selection bias). We were unable to determine the overall risk of bias in two studies (one of which was assessed as having a moderate risk of bias for a different adverse kidney outcome) due to insufficient information presented. Effect estimates for PPIs in relation to adverse kidney outcomes varied widely (0.24-7.34) but associations mostly showed increased risk. CONCLUSION: Using ROBINS-I, we found that non-randomized observational studies suggesting kidney harm by PPIs have moderate to serious risk of bias, making it challenging to establish causality. Additional high-quality, real-world evidence among generalizable populations are needed to better understand the relation between PPI treatment and acute and chronic kidney outcomes, accounting for the effects of varying durations of PPI treatment, self-treatment with over-the-counter PPIs, and potential critical confounders.",2022/02/18 06:00,10.1177_17562848221074183 [pii] and 10.1177/17562848221074183 [doi],35173802,101478893,NA,10.1177/17562848221074183 [doi] and 17562848221074183,acute interstitial nephritis and acute kidney injury and acute tubular necrosis and chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease and proton-pump inhibitors,NOTNLM,NA,NLM,NA,NA,PMC8841917,NA,"Conflict of interest statement: The authors declared the following potential and conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication and of this article: Takeda Pharmaceuticals contracted with CERobs Consulting, LLC, a and consulting firm with focus on real-world evidence observational research, and comparative effectiveness research, pragmatic randomized trials, outcomes research, and epidemiology, and clinical outcome assessments, including patient-reported outcomes. and PR, KI, TR, and CJG consulted on this project through CERobs Consulting, LLC.

Data on the effects of hydroxyurea taken for SCD during conception and pregnancy are scarce. The Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium collected self-reported pregnancy history, corresponding hydroxyurea use, and pregnancy outcomes in women with SCD in the clinical setting. Among 1285 women 18-45â€‰years of age, 737 (57.4%) reported 1788 pregnancies (1079 live births, 394 miscarriages, 40 stillbirths, 207 abortions, 48 current pregnancies, and 20 missing outcomes) of which 241 (15.9%) live births, miscarriages or stillbirths were conceived while on hydroxyurea. In univariate analyses, pregnancy number more than three, severe sickle genotype, history of stillbirth or miscarriage, and chronic kidney disease at enrollment were covariates significantly associated with a pregnancy ending in miscarriage or stillbirth.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is often associated with acute kidney injury. The causative agents of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis are usually gram-negative bacteria, but lately, the prevalence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis caused by gram-positive bacteria is rising. CASE REPORT In this report, we present the case of a 77-year-old woman with a history of cardiorenal syndrome with ascites and chronic kidney disease who was admitted with diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain. Ascitic fluid paracentesis revealed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis due to Listeria monocytogenes. During hospitalization, her ascites gradually enlarged and her kidney function deteriorated. The deterioration of kidney function was at least partially attributed to sepsis caused by spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In addition to proper antibiotic therapy with ampicillin and daily hemodialysis sessions, large-volume paracentesis and albumin infusions were instituted. After 5 days, she showed a fast improvement, the ascites subsided, and her renal function returned to baseline. CONCLUSIONS Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis caused by Listeria monocytogenes is associated with a poor outcome. Acute kidney injury in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is common and related with a poor outcome. Data about the role of large-volume paracentesis and albumin replacement in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis are still ambiguous.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients with PUV were identified at 2 large pediatric institutions in North America between 2000-2020 (The Hospital for Sick Children [SK] and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia [CHOP]). Baseline characteristics and outcome measures were compared between those diagnosed prenatally vs. postnatally. Main outcomes of interest included progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and bladder function compromise as determined by need for clean intermittent catheterization (CIC). Time-to-event analyses were completed when possible. RESULTS: During the study period, 152 patients with PUV were treated at SK (39% prenatal) and 216 patients with PUV were treated at CHOP (71% prenatal). At SK, there was no difference between prenatal and postnatal groups in the proportion of patients who required RRT, progressed to CKD stage 3 and above, or who were managed with CIC when comparing the timing of diagnosis. The time to event for RRT and CIC was significantly younger for prenatally detected PUV. At CHOP, significantly more prenatal patients required RRT, however there was no significant difference in the age this outcome was reached. The proportion of children managed with CIC was not different but the time to event was significantly earlier in the prenatal group. CONCLUSION: This study represents the largest multi-institutional series of patients with PUV and failed to identify any difference in the outcomes of prenatal versus postnatal detection of PUV.

Accumulating epidemiological data have associated vitamin K depletion with VC progression and CV outcomes. CKD patients are characterized by poor vitamin K status and at the same time, pronounced CV calcification. In early and advanced CKD, including end-stage kidney disease, exogenous supplementation of vitamin K (especially with menaquinone 7, its most bioavailable form) might decrease the inactive form of MGP (dephosphorylated, uncarboxylated MGP) and probably retard the progression or even reverse VC.

INTRODUCTION: This study aims to evaluate the comparative safety of anti-osteoporosis drugs based on the observed risk of acute myocardial infarction while on treatment in a primary care setting. METHODS: This is a propensity-matched cohort study and meta-analysis. This study was conducted in two primary care record databases covering UK NHS (CPRD) and Catalan healthcare (SIDIAP) patients during 1995-2014 and 2006-2014, respectively. The outcome was acute myocardial infarction while on treatment. Users of alendronate (reference group) were compared to those of (1) other oral bisphosphonates (OBP), (2) strontium ranelate (SR), and (3) selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM), after matching on baseline characteristics (socio-demographics, fracture risk factors, comorbidities, and concomitant drug use) using propensity scores. Multiple imputation was used to handle missing data on confounders and competing risk modelling for the calculation of relative risk (sub-distribution hazard ratios (SHR)) according to therapy. Country-specific data were analysed individually and meta-analysed. RESULTS: A 10% increased risk of acute myocardial infarction was found in users of other bisphosphonates as compared to alendronate users within CPRD. The meta-analysis of CPRD and SIDIAP results showed a 9% increased risk in users of other bisphosphonate as compared to alendronate users. Sensitivity analysis showed SERMS users with diabetes and chronic kidney disease were at an elevated risk. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides additional data on the risk of acute myocardial infarction in patients receiving osteoporosis treatment.

METHODS: We retrospectively included patients admitted to our Cardiology Division independently of their diagnosis. The total population was classified according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) categories, as follows: G1 (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) â‰¥90 mL/min/1.73 m(2)); G2 (eGFR 89-60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)); G3a (eGFR 59-45 mL/min/1.73 m(2)); G3b (eGFR 44-30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)); G4 (eGFR 29-15 mL/min/1.73 m(2)); G5 (eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). Cockcroft-Gault (CG), CG adjusted for body surface area (CG-BSA), Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), Berlin Initiative Study (BIS-1), and Full Age Spectrum (FAS) equations were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 806 patients were included. Good agreement was found between the CKD-EPI formula and CG-BSA, MDRD, BIS-1, and FAS equations. In subjects younger than 65 years or aged â‰¥85 years, CKD-EPI and MDRD showed the highest agreement (Cohen's kappa (K) 0.881 and 0.588, respectively) while CG showed the lowest. After a median follow-up of 407 days, overall mortality was 8.2%. The risk of death was higher in lower eGFR classes (G3b HR4.35; 95%CI 1.05-17.80; G4 HR7.13; 95%CI 1.63-31.23; G5 HR25.91; 95%CI 6.63-101.21). The discriminant capability of death prediction tested with ROC curves showed the best results for BIS-1 and FAS equations. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, the concordance between CKD-EPI and other equations decreased with age, with the MDRD formula showing the best agreement in both younger and older patients.

The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ranges from asymptomaticÂ to severe and potentially fatal. We aimed to describe the clinical and laboratory features and outcomes of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 within the Abu Dhabi Healthcare Services Facilities (SEHA). METHODS: Our retrospective analysis of patient data collected from electronic health records (EHRs) available from the SEHA health information system included all patients admitted from 1 March to 31 May 2020 with a laboratory-confirmed PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data of clinical features, co-morbidities, laboratory markers, length of hospital stay, treatment received and mortality were analysed according to severe versus non-severe disease. RESULTS: The study included 9390 patients. Patients were divided into severe and non-severe groups. Seven hundred twenty-one (7.68%) patients required intensive care, whereas the remaining patients (92.32%) had mild or moderate disease. The mean patient age of our cohort (41.8Â years) was lower than the global average. Our population had male predominance, and it included various nationalities. The major co-morbidities were hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. Laboratory tests revealed significant differences in lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and creatinine levels and the neutrophil count between the severe and non-severe groups. The most common anti-viral therapy was the combination of Hydroxychloroquine and Favipiravir. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 1.63%, although the rate was 19.56% in the severe group. The mortality rate was higher in adults younger than 30Â years than in those older than 60Â years (2.3% vs. 0.95%). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggested that Abu Dhabi had lower COVID-19 morbidity and mortalities rates were less than the reported rates then in China, Italy and the US. The affected population was relatively young, and it had an international representation. Globally, Abu Dhabi had one of the highest testing rates in relation to the population volume.

Patients at high risk for preeclampsia (PHRPE) have an increased risk of complications, such as fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, abnormal clotting, and liver and kidney disease. Telemonitoring for PHRPE may allow for timelier diagnosis and enhanced management, which may improve maternal and perinatal outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine the perceptions and needs of PHRPE and their health care providers with respect to telemonitoring through semistructured interviews with both groups. This study explored (1) what the needs and challenges of monitoring PHRPE are during pregnancy and in the postpartum period and (2) what features are required in a telemonitoring program to support self-care and clinical management of PHRPE. METHODS: This study used a qualitative descriptive approach, and thematic analysis was conducted. PHRPE and health care providers from a high-risk obstetrical clinic in a large academic hospital in Toronto, Canada, were asked to participate in individual semistructured interviews. Two researchers jointly developed a coding framework and separately coded each interview to ensure that the interviews were double-coded. The software program NVivo version 12 was used to help organize the codes. RESULTS: In total, 7 PHRPE and 5 health care providers, which included a nurse practitioner and physicians, participated in the semistructured interviews. Using thematic analysis, perceptions on the benefits, barriers, and desired features were determined. Perceived benefits of telemonitoring for PHRPE included close monitoring of home blood pressure (BP) measurements and appropriate interventions for abnormal BP readings; the development of a tailored telemonitoring system for pregnant patients; and facilitation of self-management. Perceived barriers to telemonitoring for PHRPE included financial and personal barriers, as well as the potential for increased clinician workload. Desired features of a secure platform for PHRPE included the facilitation of self-management for patients and decision making for clinicians, as well as the inclusion of evidence-based action prompts. CONCLUSIONS: The perceptions of patients and providers on the use of telemonitoring for PHRPE support the need for a telemonitoring program for the management of PHRPE.

Studies comparing hospitalisations between peritoneal dialysis (PD) and haemodialysis (HD) report conflicting results and mostly analyse data of patients that remain on their initial dialysis modality. This cohort study compares hospitalisations between PD and HD patients taking into account transitions between modalities. METHODS: The Dutch nOcturnal and hoME dialysis Study To Improve Clinical Outcomes collected hospitalisation data of patients who started dialysis between 2012 and 2017. Primary outcome was hospitalisation rate, analysed with a multi-state model that attributed each hospitalisation to the current dialysis modality. RESULTS: In total, 695 patients (252 PD, 443 HD) treated in 31 Dutch hospitals were included. The crude hospitalisation rate for PD was 2.3 (Â Â±Â 5.0) and for HD 1.4 (Â Â±Â 3.2) hospitalisations per patient-year. The adjusted hazard ratio for hospitalisation rate was 1.1 (95%CI 1.02-1.3) for PD compared with HD. The risk for first hospitalisation was 1.3 times (95%CI 1.1-1.6) higher for PD compared with HD during the first year after dialysis initiation. The number of hospitalisations and number of hospital days per patient-year were significantly higher for PD. The most common causes of PD and HD hospitalisations were peritonitis (23%) and vascular access-related problems (33%). CONCLUSION: PD was associated with higher hospitalisation rate, higher risk for first hospitalisation and higher number of hospitalisations compared with HD. Since the PD hospitalisations were mainly caused by peritonitis, more attention to infection prevention is necessary for reducing the number of hospitalisations in the future.",2022/02/08 06:00,10.1111/eci.13758 [doi],35129213,0245331,England,10.1111/eci.13758 [doi],end-stage kidney disease and haemodialysis and hospitalisation and peritoneal dialysis,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20220207,Â© 2022 The Authors.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia seen in critically ill patients. The impact of AF on the outcomes in patients with ARDS is less understood. In this analysis we attempt to evaluate the association of concurrent AF and various clinical outcomes in patients with ARDS. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of adult discharges from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) between 2004 and 2014. International Classification of Disease codes were used to identify those with ARDS and AF. RESULTS: We found 1,200,737 hospitalizations with ARDS, out of which 238,455 had concomitant diagnosis of AF. Hospitalizations with AF had higher prevalence of comorbidities including chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, congestive heart failure and renal failure. On adjusted analysis, AF was associated with increased odds of acute myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, pressor use, acute kidney injury, permanent pacemaker implantation, cardiac arrest, mechanical circulatory support use and higher length of stay and inflation-adjusted cost in hospitalizations with ARDS. However, there was no significant difference in adjusted all-cause mortality in ARDS with and without AF (25.42% vs 20.23%, p=0.53). CONCLUSIONS: AF is associated with worse clinical outcomes, higher length of stay and cost in ARDS hospitalizations as compared to those without AF.",2022/02/10 06:00,S0002-9629(22)00066-0 [pii] and 10.1016/j.amjms.2022.01.020 [doi],35139331,0370506,United States,S0002-9629(22)00066-0 [pii] and 10.1016/j.amjms.2022.01.020 [doi],Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Arrhythmia and Atrial Fibrillation and Critical Care and Electrophysiology,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,Conflict of Interests None Declared,20220206,Copyright Â© 2022.

However, the relevance of deceased donor proteinuria on transplant outcome remains uncertain. In this nationwide cohort study, we evaluated the prevalence of proteinuria in deceased donor candidates and measured the impact on outcome after kidney transplantation. METHODS: Data from the Swiss Organ Allocation System and the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study were analyzed, comprising 1725 donors and 1516 recipients transplanted between 2008 and 2019. We correlated urine findings with donor characteristics and quantified the impact of proteinuria on allograft function at 12Â months and survival. RESULTS: Proteinuria influenced allocation decisions in 4.5% of nonimmunological organ declines and was the leading cause for decline in 0.2% of cases. 74.1%, 51.4%, and 35.3% of donor candidates had a baseline proteinuria above 15, 30, and 50Â mg protein/mmol urine creatinine, respectively. Proteinuria above 30Â mg/mmol was associated with female donor sex, mechanical resuscitation, acute kidney injury, and time delay between ICU entry and urine sampling. Donor proteinuria was not associated with patient or allograft survival, nor allograft function at 12Â months. CONCLUSION: We report a high prevalence of proteinuria in donor candidates, without evidence of a deleterious impact of proteinuria on graft function and/or survival. Therefore, low-level proteinuria should not be considered a limiting contraindication for kidney allocation in deceased donor transplant.",2022/02/07 06:00,10.1111/ctr.14574 [doi],35124857,8710240,Denmark,10.1111/ctr.14574 [doi],deceased donor transplantation and donor evaluation and kidney transplantation and proteinuria,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20220206,Â© 2022 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Among 4398 patients with diagnosis of AF in the outpatient department of Kyoto University Hospital between January 2005 and March 2015, we identified 537 pairs of patients who received first-time catheter ablation (ablation group) or conservative management (conservative group), matched for age, gender, AF duration, AF type, AF symptoms, and previous heart failure (HF). The primary outcome measure was a composite of cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization, ischemic stroke, or major bleeding. Most baseline characteristics were well balanced between the 2 groups, except for the higher prevalence of low body weight, history of malignancy, and severe chronic kidney disease in the conservative group.

We aimed to identify factors associated with the level of HL in a CKD population that has not been studied previously. METHODS: Patients with stage I-V (non-dialysis) CKD according to the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative classification were enrolled in the study from two tertiary healthcare centers. Data were collected cross-sectionally using the European Health Literacy Survey (HLS-EU). RESULTS: Data of 208 participants were analyzed. HLS-EU scores had the highest correlations with age (râ€‰=â€‰-Â 0.494, pâ€‰=â€‰0.0001) and education (râ€‰=â€‰0.476, pâ€‰=â€‰0.0001). Estimated glomerular filtration rate (e-GFR) was significantly correlated with HLS-EU score (râ€‰=â€‰0.186, pâ€‰=â€‰0.01). Presence of a self-reported acquaintance with any kind of kidney disease was associated with higher HL. On the other hand, participants with multiple comorbidities, and therefore with more frequent contact with the health system, had lower HL than those without such frequent contact. Similarly, those with a high disease burden had lower HL than those without. HLS-EU scores were also significantly associated with gender, marital status, occupational status, self-perception of health, restriction of daily activities, participation in social activities, place of residence, blood pressure, body mass index, and serum parathyroid hormone and albumin levels. CONCLUSION: Low HL is prevalent among CKD patients and is associated with e-GFR. Presence of an acquaintance with any kind of kidney disease is positively associated with HL.

In the present study, we included CLTI patients and studied sex-related differences in their risk profile, vascular procedures, and long-term outcome. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed 199â€‰953 unselected patients of the largest public health insurance in Germany (AOK: Local healthcare funds), hospitalized between 2010 and 2017 for a main diagnosis of CLTI. A baseline period of 2 years before index hospitalization to assess comorbidities and previous procedures, and a follow-up period until 2018 were included. Female CLTI patients were older (median 81.4 vs. 73.8 years in males; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and more often diagnosed with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, chronic heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. Male patients suffered more frequently from diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, smoking, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic coronary syndrome (all Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Within hospitalized CLTI patients, females represent the minority (43% vs. 57%; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and during index hospitalization, women underwent less frequently diagnostic angiographies (67 vs. 70%) and revascularization procedures (61 vs. 65%; both Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Moreover, women received less frequently guideline-recommended drugs like statins (35 vs. 43%) and antithrombotic therapy (48 vs. 53%; both Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) at baseline. Interestingly, after including age and comorbidities in a Cox regression analysis, female sex was associated with increased overall-survival (OS) [hazard ratio (HR) 0.95; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-0.96] and amputation-free survival (AFS) (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.83-0.85; both Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). CONCLUSION: Female patients with CLTI were older, underwent less often vascular procedures, and received less frequently guideline-recommended medication. Nevertheless, female sex was independently associated with better OS and AFS during follow-up. KEY QUESTION: Analysis of sex-related differences in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischaemia (CLTI), with a focus on their risk profile, treatment, and long-term outcome. KEY FINDING: Female CLTI patients were older, underwent vascular procedures less often, and received less frequently guideline-recommended drugs, but female sex was associated with better outcome. TAKE-HOME MESSAGE: Chronic limb-threatening ischaemia should be considered as a multi-organ disease with an ever increasing prevalence and a poor prognosis. Chronic limb-threatening ischaemia patients partly do not receive optimal therapy, and this is more prominent in females.",2022/02/09 06:00,6521659 [pii] and 10.1093/eurheartj/ehac016 [doi],35134893,8006263,England,ehac016 [pii] and 10.1093/eurheartj/ehac016 [doi],Amputation-free-survival and CLTI and LEAD and Outcome research and Overall-survival and Sex differences,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20220203,Â© The Author(s) 2022.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study of new users of SGLT-2 inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors with T2D and CKD using data from Optum Clinformatics DataMart. We assembled three cohorts: T2D/no CKD, T2D/CKD 1-2, and T2D/CKD 3a. The study outcomes were (a) time to first heart failure (HF) hospitalization and (b) time to a composite CV endpoint comprised of non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke. After inverse probability of treatment weighting, we used proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: New users of SGLT-2 inhibitors versus DPP-4 inhibitors had lower risks of HF hospitalization in the T2D/no CKD (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.70, 0.82) and T2D/CKD 1-2 (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.48, 0.84) cohorts, but no significant association was present in the T2D/CKD 3a cohort. Compared with prescription of DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors were associated with lower risks of non-fatal MI or stroke of 23% (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.70, 0.85) in the T2D/no CKD cohort, but no significant associations were present in the T2D/CKD 1-2 and T2D/CKD 3a cohorts.

We aimed to review the burden of R-HTN across the world, focusing on its prevalence, associated factors and outcomes, and the impact of treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: R-HTN prevalence among hypertensive individuals varies around 10-20%, depending on the population and definition applied. R-HTN consistently relates to older age, chronic kidney disease, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea - which are increasing in prevalence with global population aging. As such, R-HTN prevalence is also expected to rise. Infrequent use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to identify at higher risk individuals and poor adherence to treatment are still barriers in the approach of R-HTN. Available evidence suggests that 10-20% of patients with hypertension have R-HTN. However, the prevalence of true R-HTN using contemporaneous standardized definitions is still unknown. Novel strategies to address clinicians, patients and health system barriers to treatment inertia and adherence are fundamental to reduce the burden of R-HTN.",2022/02/05 06:00,10.1007/s11906-022-01173-w [pii] and 10.1007/s11906-022-01173-w [doi],35118612,100888982,United States,10.1007/s11906-022-01173-w [doi],Burden of disease and Global health and Resistant hypertension,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20220203,"Â© 2022.

The prognostic impact of the extent of medial vascular calcification at KT is unknown. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we investigated the impact of medial calcification compared to a mix of intimal and medial calcification represented by coronary artery calcification (CAC score) and aortic valve calcification in 342 patients starting on kidney failure replacement therapy. The primary outcomes were cardiovascular events (CVE) and death. The median follow-up time was 6.4 years (interquartile range 3.7-9.6 years). Exposure was CAC score and arteria epigastrica medial calcification scored as none, mild, moderate, or severe by a pathologist at time of KT (n = 200). We divided the patients according to kidney failure replacement therapy during follow-up, that is, living donor KT, deceased donor KT, or dialysis. RESULTS: Moderate to severe medial calcification in the arteria epigastrica was associated with higher mortality (p = 0.001), and the hazard ratio for CVE was 3.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-9.02, p < 0.05) compared to no or mild medial calcification. The hazard ratio for 10-year mortality in the dialysis group was 33.6 (95% CI, 10.0-113.0, p < 0.001) compared to living donor recipients, independent of Framingham risk score and prevalent CAC. CONCLUSION: Scoring of medial calcification in the arteria epigastrica identified living donor recipients as having 3.1 times higher risk of CVE, independent of traditional risk factors.

The clinical implications of these differences, eGFRdiffcys-cr, are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the associations of eGFRdiffcys-cr with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and mortality among individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a prospective cohort study of 4956 individuals with mild to moderate CKD from 7 clinical centers in the United States who enrolled in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study between 2003 to 2018. Statistical analyses were completed in December 2021. EXPOSURES: eGFRdiffcys-cr (eGFRcysâ€‰-â€‰eGFRcr) was calculated at baseline and annually thereafter for 3 years. Because 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 represents a clinically meaningful difference in eGFR that also distinguishes CKD stages, eGFRdiffcys-cr was categorized as: less than -15 mL/min/1.73 m2, -15 to 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or greater. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The outcomes of ESKD, defined as initiation of maintenance dialysis or receipt of a kidney transplant, and all-cause mortality were adjudicated from study entry until administrative censoring in 2018. RESULTS: Among 4956 participants with mean (SD) age of 59.5 (10.5) years, 2152 (43.4%) were Black, 515 (10.4%) were Hispanic, and 2113 (42.6%) were White. There were 2156 (43.5%) women and 2800 (56.5%) men. At baseline, eGFRcys and eGFRcr values differed by more than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 in one-third of participants (1638 participants [33.1%]). Compared with participants with similar baseline eGFRcys and eGFRcr (eGFRdiffcys-cr -15 to 15 mL/min/1.73 m2), those in whom eGFRcys was substantially lower than eGFRcr (eGFRdiffcys-crâ€‰<â€‰-15 mL/min/1.73 m2) had a higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.86; 95% CI, 1.40-2.48) while those with eGFRdiffcys-cr of 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or greater had lower risks of ESKD (subHR [SHR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59-0.89) and mortality (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, CI 0.58-0.81). In time-updated analyses, participants with eGFRdiffcys-cr less than -15 mL/min/1.73 m2 had higher risks of ESKD (SHR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.10-3.04) and mortality (HR, 3.03; 95% CI, 2.19-4.19) compared with participants with similar eGFRcys and eGFRcr. Conversely, participants with eGFRdiffcys-cr of 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or greater had lower risks of ESKD (SHR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.35-0.71) and mortality (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.45-0.75). Longitudinal changes in eGFRdiffcys-cr were associated with mortality risk. Compared with participants who had similar slopes by eGFRcys and eGFRcr, those with smaller eGFRcr declines had an 8-fold increased mortality risk (HR, 8.20; 95% CI, 6.37-10.56), and those with larger apparent declines by eGFRcr had a lower mortality risk (HR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.08-0.24). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that large differences between eGFRcys and eGFRcr were common in persons with CKD. These differences and their changes over time may be informative of ESKD and mortality risks, warranting monitoring of both eGFRcys and eGFRcr in this high-risk population.",2022/02/18 06:00,2789130 [pii] and 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.48940 [doi],35175342,101729235,United States,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.48940 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20220201,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Nevertheless, the association between diabetes and major bleeding complications of PRB remains unclear. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study using the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database in Japan, we identified patients who underwent an elective PRB from July 2010 to March 2018. The primary outcome was the occurrence of major bleeding complications, defined as red blood cell transfusion within 7 days after PRB or invasive hemostasis after PRB. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to analyze the association between diabetes and major bleeding complications with adjustment for patient and hospital characteristics. RESULTS: We identified 76,302 patients, including 8245 with diabetes. The proportion of PRBs performed for patients with diabetes continuously increased over time. Major bleeding complications occurred in 678 patients (0.9%), including 622 (0.8%) with red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and 109 (0.1%) with invasive hemostasis. Diabetes was significantly associated with major bleeding complications (relative risk [RR]Â = 2.41; 95% CI 2.00-2.90). Among patients with diabetes, multiagent or insulin treatment had significant association with major bleeding complications (RRÂ = 1.57; 95% CI 1.18-2.10), compared with single-agent diabetes treatment. CONCLUSION: Diabetes is significantly associated with major bleeding complications of PRBs. Moreover, severity of diabetes has association with increases in major bleeding complications. Thus, nephrologists should carefully judge whether the anticipated benefits outweigh the relatively high risk of major bleeding complications when considering PRB for patients with diabetes.",2022/02/15 06:01,S2468-0249(21)01519-9 [pii] and 10.1016/j.ekir.2021.11.013 [doi],35155862,101684752,NA,10.1016/j.ekir.2021.11.013 [doi],bleeding complications and diabetes and kidney biopsy and renal biopsy,NOTNLM,NA,NLM,NA,NA,PMC8821035,NA,NA,20211125,Â© 2021 International Society of Nephrology.

Recently, the link between phosphate metabolism and iron dynamics has received increasing attention. However, the association between this relationship and prognosis remains largely unexplored. METHODS: We conducted an observational study of patients who initiated dialysis in the 17 centers participating in the Aichi Cohort Study of the Prognosis in Patients Newly Initiated into Dialysis. Data were available on sex, age, use of phosphate binder, drug history, medical history and laboratory data. After excluding patients with missing values of phosphate, hemoglobin, ferritin and transferrin saturation, we used the Gaussian mixture model to divide the cohort into clusters based on phosphate, hemoglobin, logarithmic ferritin and transferrin saturation. We investigated the prognosis of patients in these clusters. The primary outcome was all-cause death. In each cluster, the prognostic impact of phosphate binder was also studied. RESULTS: The study included 1175 patients with chronic kidney disease who initiated dialysis between October 2011 and September 2013. Among them, 785 were men and 390 were women, with a mean Â± SD age of 67.9Â Â± 13.0 years. The patients were divided into three clusters, and mortality was higher in cluster c than in cluster a (PÂ =Â 0.005). Moreover, the use of phosphate binders was associated with a lower risk of all-cause death in two clusters (a and c) that were characterized by older age and higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus, among other things. CONCLUSIONS: We used an unsupervised machine learning method to cluster patients, using phosphate, hemoglobin and iron-related markers. In two of the clusters, the oral use of a phosphate binder might improve prognosis.",2022/02/12 06:01,sfab207 [pii] and 10.1093/ckj/sfab207 [doi],35145647,101579321,NA,10.1093/ckj/sfab207 [doi],chronic kidney disease and dialysis and iron and machine learning and mortality and phosphate,NOTNLM,NA,NLM,NA,NA,PMC8824794,NA,NA,20211014,Â© The Author(s) 2021.

Timing of onset of acute kidney injury (AKI) during pediatric critical illness and impact on outcomes has not been fully explored. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of the Assessment of Worldwide Acute Kidney Injury, Renal Angina and Epidemiology (AWARE) database. AKI was defined as per Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Early AKI was defined as diagnosed at â‰¤48 h after intensive care unit (ICU) admission, with any diagnosis >48 h denoted as late AKI. Transient AKI was defined as return to baseline serum creatinine â‰¤48 h of onset, and those without recovery fell into the persistent category. A second incidence of AKI â‰¥48 h after recovery was denoted as recurrent. Patients were subsequently sorted into distinct phenotypes as early-transient, late-transient, early-persistent, late-persistent and recurrent. Primary outcome was major adverse kidney events (MAKE) at 28 days (MAKE28) or at study exit, with secondary outcomes including AKI-free days, ICU length of stay and inpatient renal replacement therapy. RESULTS: A total of 1262 patients had AKI and were included. Overall mortality rate was 6.4% (nÂ =Â 81), with 34.2% (nÂ =Â 432) fulfilling at least one MAKE28 criteria. The majority of patients fell in the early-transient cohort (nÂ =Â 704, 55.8%). The early-persistent phenotype had the highest odds of MAKE28 (odds ratio 7.84, 95% confidence interval 5.45-11.3), and the highest mortality rate (18.8%). Oncologic and nephrologic/urologic comorbidities at AKI diagnosis were associated with MAKE28. CONCLUSION: Temporal nature and trajectory of AKI during a critical care course are significantly associated with patient outcomes, with several subtypes at higher risk for poorer outcomes.

The present retrospective observational cohort study aimed to define the prevalence, progression rate, risk factors and clinical implications of BAC in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients across stages of disease. The presence and extent of BAC were determined on mammograms in 310 females (58.7Â Â± 10.8 years, Caucasian) with CKD across various stages of disease [CKD G2-5D nÂ =Â 132; transplant (Tx) recipients nÂ =Â 178]. In a subset of 88 patients, repeat mammography was performed, allowing us to calculate the annualized BAC rate. Overall, BAC was observed in 34.7% of the patients. BAC prevalence (PÂ =Â 0.02) and BAC score (PÂ =Â 0.05) increased along the progression of CKD. In the overall cohort, patients with BAC were characterized by older age, more cardiovascular disease, more inflammation, higher pulse pressure and borderline higher prevalence of diabetes and were more often treated with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA). The BAC progression rate was significantly lower in Tx patients as compared with CKD G5D. Progressors were characterized by more inflammation, worse kidney function, higher BAC score and higher serum phosphate level (Tx only) at baseline and were more often treated with a VKA. Major adverse cardiovascular event-free survival was significantly worse in Tx patients with BAC. In conclusion, BAC is common among CKD patients, progresses at a slower pace in Tx patients as compared with CKD 5D and associates with dismal cardiovascular outcomes.

We characterized patients with NDD-CKD and anemia using real-world data from the USA. METHODS: This retrospective longitudinal observational study evaluated integrated Limited Claims and Electronic Health Record Data (IBM Health, Armonk, NY), including patients â‰¥18 years with two or more estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) measures <60Â mL/min/1.73Â m(2) â‰¥90 days apart. Anemia was defined as the first observed hemoglobin <10Â g/dL within 6-month pre- and post-CKD index date. Data were analyzed from January 2012 to June 2018. Patients with documented iron-deficiency anemia at baseline were excluded. RESULTS: Comprising 22â€‰720 patients (57.4% female, 63.9% CKD stage 3, median hemoglobin 12.5Â g/dL), median (interquartile range) follow-up for patients with and without anemia were 2.9 (1.5-4.4) and 3.8 (2.2-4.8) years, respectively. The most prevalent comorbidities were dyslipidemia (57.6%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (38.8%) and uncontrolled hypertension (20.0%). Overall, 23.3% of patients had anemia, of whom 1.9% and <0.1%Â received erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) or intravenous iron, respectively. Anemia prevalence increased with CKD stage from 18.2% (stage 3a) to 72.8% (stage 5). Patients with anemia had a higher incidence rate of hospitalizations for heart failure (1.6 versus 0.8 per 100 patient-years), CKD stage advancement (43.5 versus 27.5 per 100 patient-years), and a 40% eGFR decrease (18.1 versus 7.3 per 100 patient-years) versus those without anemia. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia, frequently observed in NDD-CKD and associated with adverse clinical outcomes, is rarely treated with ESAs and intravenous iron.

We sought to determine trends in in-hospital and 1-year mortality associated with AKI as defined by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes consensus criteria. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This retrospective cohort study used data from the national Veterans Health Administration on all patients hospitalized from October 1, 2008 to September 31, 2017. AKI was defined by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes serum creatinine criteria. In-hospital and 1-year mortality trends were analyzed in patients with and without AKI using Cox regression with year as a continuous variable. RESULTS: We identified 1,688,457 patients and 2,689,093 hospitalizations across the study period. Among patients with AKI, 6% died in hospital, and 28% died within 1 year. In contrast, in-hospital and 1-year mortality rates were 0.8% and 14%, respectively, among non-AKI hospitalizations. During the study period, there was a slight decline in crude in-hospital AKI-associated mortality (hazard ratio, 0.98 per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.98 to 0.99) that was attenuated after accounting for patient demographics, comorbid conditions, and acute hospitalization characteristics (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.99 per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.00). This stable temporal trend in mortality persisted at 1 year (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.00 per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.00). CONCLUSIONS: AKI associated mortality remains high, as greater than one in four patients with AKI died within 1 year of hospitalization. Over the past decade, there seems to have been no significant progress toward improving in-hospital or long-term AKI survivorship.",2022/02/09 06:00,17/2/184 [pii] and 10.2215/CJN.01730221 [doi],35131927,101271570,United States,10.2215/CJN.01730221 [doi],*acute kidney injury and *cohort studies and *epidemiology and outcomes and *mortality and *veterans,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Copyright Â© 2022 by the American Society of Nephrology.,NA,Clin J Am Soc Nephrol. 2022 Feb;17(2):179-181.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of 856 participants from the Canadian Positive Brain Health Now cohort. METHODS: The frailty indicator phenotype was adapted from Fried's criteria using self-report items. Univariate logistic regression and classification and regression tree (CaRT) models were used to identify the most relevant independent contributors to frailty. RESULTS: In all, 100Â men (14.0%) and 26 women (19.7%) were identified as frail (â‰¥Â 3/5 criteria) for an overall prevalence of 15.2%. Nine comorbidities showed an influential association with frailty. The most influential comorbidities were hypothyroidism [odds ratio (OR) = 2.55, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.29-50.3] and arthritis (OR = 2.54, 95% CI: 1.58-4.09). Additionally, tobacco (OR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.05-3.04) showed an association. Any level of alcohol consumption showed a protective effect for frailty. The CaRT model showed nine pathways that led to frailty. Arthritis was the most discriminatory variable followed by alcohol, hypothyroidism, tobacco, cancer, cannabis, liver disease, kidney disease, osteoporosis, lung disease and peripheral vascular disease. The prevalence of physical frailty for people with arthritis was 27.4%; with additional cancer or tobacco and alcohol the prevalence rates were 47.1% and 46.1%, respectively. The protective effect of alcohol consumption evident in the univariate model appeared again in the CaRT model, but this effect varied. Cognitive frailty (19.5% overall) and emotional frailty (37.9% overall) were higher than the prevalence of physical frailty. CONCLUSIONS: Specific comorbidities and tobacco use were implicated in frailty, suggesting that it is comorbidities causing frailty. However, some frailty still appears to be HIV-related. The higher prevalence of cognitive and emotional frailty highlights the fact that physical frailty should not be the only focus in HIV.",2022/02/03 06:00,10.1111/hiv.13236 [doi],35106895,100897392,England,10.1111/hiv.13236 [doi],HIV and ageing and cannabis and cognitive and comorbidity and emotional and frailty and tobacco,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20220201,Â© 2022 British HIV Association.,CAPMC/CIHR/Canada,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Dipstick urinalysis is frequently obtained, but data regarding the prognostic value of hematuria and proteinuria for kidney outcomes is scarce. METHODS: Patients with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) PCR, who had a urinalysis obtained on admission to one of 20 hospitals, were included. Nested models with degree of hematuria and proteinuria were used to predict AKI and RRT during admission. Presence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and baseline serum creatinine were added to test improvement in model fit. RESULTS: Of 5,980 individuals, 829 (13.9%) developed an AKI during admission, and 149 (18.0%) of those with AKI received RRT. Proteinuria and hematuria degrees significantly increased with AKI severity (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001 for both). Any degree of proteinuria and hematuria was associated with an increased risk of AKI and RRT. In predictive models for AKI, presence of CKD improved the area under the curve (AUC) (95% confidence interval) to 0.73 (0.71, 0.75), Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001, and adding baseline creatinine improved the AUC to 0.85 (0.83, 0.86), Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001, when compared to the base model AUC using only proteinuria and hematuria, AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.64 (0.62, 0.67). In RRT models, CKD status improved the AUC to 0.78 (0.75, 0.82), Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001, and baseline creatinine improved the AUC to 0.84 (0.80, 0.88), Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001, compared to the base model, AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.72 (0.68, 0.76). There was no significant improvement in model discrimination when both CKD and baseline serum creatinine were included. CONCLUSIONS: Proteinuria and hematuria values on dipstick urinalysis can be utilized to predict AKI and RRT in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We derived formulas using these two readily available values to help prognosticate kidney outcomes in these patients. Furthermore, the incorporation of CKD or baseline creatinine increases the accuracy of these formulas.",2022/02/11 06:00,10.1186/s12882-022-02677-y [pii] and 2677 [pii] and 10.1186/s12882-022-02677-y [doi],35105331,100967793,NA,10.1186/s12882-022-02677-y [doi] and 50,*AKI and *COVID-19 and *Hematuria and *Predictive model and *Proteinuria and *Urinalysis,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,20220210,"Acute Kidney Injury/ethnology/*etiology/therapy and Aged and Area Under Curve and COVID-19/*complications/ethnology and Confidence Intervals and Creatinine/blood and Female and Hematuria/*diagnosis and Hospitalization and Humans and Longitudinal Studies and Male and Middle Aged and Predictive Value of Tests and Proteinuria/*diagnosis and Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/diagnosis and Renal Replacement Therapy/statistics & numerical data and Urinalysis/*methods",PMC8805668,AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine),The authors declare that they have no competing interests.,20220201,Â© 2022.

Hospitalizations are the largest component of direct costs for HF; however, recent syntheses of the economic and clinical burden of hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To synthesize contemporary estimates of cost and clinical outcomes of HHF in the United States. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using MEDLINE and Embase to identify articles reporting cost or charge per HHF in the United States published between January 2014 and May 2019. Subgroups of interest were those with both HF and renal disease or diabetes, as well as HF with reduced or preserved ejection fraction (HFrEF or HFpEF). RESULTS: 23 studies reporting cost and/or charge per HHF were included. Sample sizes ranged from 989 to approximately 11 million (weighted), mean age from 65 to 83 years, and 39% to 74% were male. Cost per HHF ranged from $7,094 to $9,769 (median) and $10,737 to $17,830 (mean). Charge per HHF ranged from $22,162 to $40,121 (median), and $50,569 to $50,952 (mean). Among patients with renal disease, HHF mean cost ranged from $9,922 to $41,538. For those with HFrEF or HFpEF, mean cost ranged from $11,600 to $17,779 and $7,860 to $10,551, respectively. No eligible studies were identified that reported HHF costs or charges among patients with HF and diabetes. Cost and charge per HHF increased with length of stay, which ranged from 3 to 5 days (median) and 4 to 7 days (mean). CONCLUSIONS: This synthesis demonstrates the substantial economic burden of HHF and the variability in estimates of this burden. Factors contributing to variability in estimates include length of stay, age and sex of the sample, HF severity, and frequencies of comorbidities. Further research into cost drivers of HHF is warranted to understand potential mechanisms to reduce associated costs. DISCLOSURES: This study was funded by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals.

We examined the risk of cardiovascular hospitalization up to 3 decades after having a pregnancy complicated by severe maternal morbidity. METHODS: We analyzed a longitudinal cohort of 1â€‰336â€‰846 women who were pregnant between 1989 and 2019 in Quebec, Canada. The main exposure measure was severe maternal morbidity in any pregnancy, including severe preeclampsia, acute renal failure, sepsis, and other life-threatening conditions. Using time-varying Cox regression models, we compared the adjusted risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular disease up to 3 decades after pregnancy for women with severe maternal morbidity relative to women without severe morbidity. RESULTS: Five percent of women had severe maternal morbidity. Overall, there were 68â€‰287 cardiovascular hospitalizations during 21â€‰725â€‰672 person-years of follow-up in the cohort. Compared with no morbidity, women with any severe morbidity had a greater risk of cardiovascular hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR], 1.77 [95% CI, 1.72-1.82]). The association was the greatest within the first year of delivery (HR, 4.42 [95% CI, 3.77-5.19]) but persisted beyond 15 years (HR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.37-1.51]). Having a cardiac complication (HR, 5.37 [95% CI, 4.65-6.20]), cerebrovascular accident (HR, 3.82 [95% CI, 2.94-4.96]), or acute renal failure (HR, 2.60 [95% CI, 2.15-3.14]) during pregnancy was strongly associated with future cardiovascular hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Women with severe maternal morbidity have a greater risk of cardiovascular disease after pregnancy, both in the short and long term.

A plausible explanation for increased mortality was prehospital delay because of patients' reticence of their symptoms. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between prehospital delay and clinical outcomes in patients with NSTEMI METHODS: Among 13,104 patients from the Korea-Acute-Myocardial-Infarction-Registry-National Institutes of Health, the authors evaluated 6,544 patients with NSTEMI. Study patients were categorized into 2 groups according to symptom-to-door (StD) time (<24 orÂ â‰¥24 hours). The primary outcome was 3-year all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcome was 3-year composite of all-cause mortality, recurrent MI, and hospitalization for heart failure. RESULTS: Overall, 1,827 (27.9%) patients were classified into the StD timeÂ â‰¥24 hours group. The StD timeÂ â‰¥24 hours group had higher all-cause mortality (17.0% vs 10.5%; PÂ < 0.001) and incidence of secondary outcomes (23.3% vs 15.7%; PÂ < 0.001) than the StD timeÂ <24 hours group. The higher all-cause mortality in the StD timeÂ â‰¥24 hours group was observed consistently in the subgroup analysis regarding age, sex, atypical chest pain, dyspnea, Q-wave in electrocardiogram, use of emergency medical services, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, left ventricle dysfunction, TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) flow, and the GRACE risk score. In the multivariable analysis, independent predictors of prehospital delay were the elderly, women, nonspecific symptoms such as atypical chest pain or dyspnea, diabetes, and no use of emergency medical services. CONCLUSIONS: Prehospital delay is associated with an increased risk of 3-year all-cause mortality in patients with NSTEMI.

However, information on disposition and outcomes in these patients is scarce. We conducted a nationwide study to assess disposition from ED, hospitalization rates, in-hospital outcomes, and health care costs in patients with history of CU who presented to the ED with CP. METHODS: We queried the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample database from 2016-2018 for adult patients with CU presenting to the ED with CP. International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes were used to identify study patients. RESULTS: We identified 149,372 patients. The majority were male (76%), presented to metropolitan centers (91.3%), and had a high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (48.1% with hypertension, 24.4% with coronary artery disease, 18.2% with diabetes) and psychiatric illnesses (21%). Overall, 21.4% of patients were hospitalized, 68.6% were discharged from ED and 6.6% left against medical advice. Patients requiring admission were older (51.8Â vs 45.0; PÂ <Â 0.0001) and had a higher prevalence of coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. Of those admitted, 45.7% were diagnosed with myocardial infarction (MI), constituting 9.7% of the total study population. Over 80% of these patients underwent coronary angiography and 38.6% had coronary intervention. Mortality was 1.2%. CONCLUSION: CU patients who present to ED are predominantly male, are from lower economic strata, and have significant comorbidity burden. One in 5 patients requires hospitalization and has more prevalent cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities. In-hospital mortality is low, but incidence of MI and subsequent invasive procedures is high. CU may be considered a cardiac risk factor as it is associated with high rates of in-hospital MI.",2022/01/25 06:01,EMP212618 [pii] and 10.1002/emp2.12618 [doi],35072159,101764779,NA,10.1002/emp2.12618 [doi] and e12618,chest pain and cocaine use and coronary artery disease and emergency department and myocardial infarction,NOTNLM,NA,NLM,NA,NA,PMC8760951,NA,All authors do not have any conflicts of interest to disclose.,20220115,Â© 2022 The Authors.

The prevalence of secondary RLS among comorbid conditions such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, end-stage renal disease, irritable bowel syndrome and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder have further elucidated our understanding of the role of the iron-dopamine hypothesis as an etiopathogenetic hallmark in RLS and the efficacy of therapeutic approaches in milder to more severe forms. Currently, RLS treatment uses only symptomatic agents, since a disease-modifying therapy does not yet exist.

Less is known concerning the risk of postoperative cardiovascular events in geriatric hip fracture patients with CKD. METHODS: This study involved patients at least 65 years of age who received surgery for acute hip fracture between January 2000 and April 2016. We identified CKD patients with a baseline diagnosis of CKD or an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60Â mL/min/1.73 m(2) at admission. Each CKD patient was matched, for age, gender, fracture type, and year of admission, with 4 control non-CKD patients. The primary endpoint was a compositepostoperative cardiovascular events, including pulmonary embolism, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, heart failure, arrhythmia, stroke, and death. Conditional logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between CKD and the outcome after adjusting for potential confounders including age, gender, fracture type, body mass index, preexisting comorbidities, history of cardiovascular events, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). RESULTS: Three hundred and seventy-five CKD patients were matched with 1,438 non-CKD patients. The mean age of the CKD patients was 81.9Â Â±Â 7.0 (mean Â± SD), 69.9% were females, and 59.2% had an intertrochanteric fracture. Compared to non-CKD patients, CKD patients had a higher proportion of preexisting comorbidities, including hypertension, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and type 2 diabetes (all p < 0.05). The risk of postoperative cardiovascular events was 125.3 per 1000 persons (95%CI, 91.8-158.8) in CKD patients and 64.7 per 1000 persons (95%CI, 52.0-77.4) in non-CKD patients. A 1.96-fold risk of cardiovascular events after hip fracture surgery was found in CKD patients than those without CKD (adjusted OR, 1.96; 95%CI, 1.23-3.12). CONCLUSION: Patients with CKD were more likely to have cardiovascular events after hip fracture surgery than those without CKD. Appropriate preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment and corresponding preventive and therapeutic measures should be given to this vulnerable population to mitigate such complications.",2022/02/08 06:00,S0020-1383(21)01044-5 [pii] and 10.1016/j.injury.2021.12.032 [doi],34974909,0226040,Netherlands,S0020-1383(21)01044-5 [pii] and 10.1016/j.injury.2021.12.032 [doi],Chronic kidney disease and Complication and Hip fracture and Postoperative cardiovascular events,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,20220207,"Aged and *Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology and *Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 and Female and Glomerular Filtration Rate and *Hip Fractures/epidemiology/surgery and Humans and *Pelvic Bones and *Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/complications/epidemiology and Risk Factors",NA,NA,Declaration of Competing Interest All authors declared no conflict of interest.,20211223,Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Substantial advances have been made in our understanding of the excess CMR burden in gout, ranging from pathogenesis underlying excess CMR comorbidities, inferring causal relationships from Mendelian randomization studies, and potentially discovering urate crystals in coronary arteries using advanced imaging, to clinical trials and observational studies. Despite many studies finding an independent association between blood urate levels and risk of incident CMR events, Mendelian randomization studies have largely found that serum urate is not causal for CMR end points or intermediate risk factors or outcomes (such as kidney function, adiposity, metabolic syndrome, glycaemic traits or blood lipid concentrations). Although limited, randomized controlled trials to date in adults without gout support this conclusion. If imaging studies suggesting that monosodium urate crystals are deposited in coronary plaques in patients with gout are confirmed, it is possible that these crystals might have a role in the inflammatory pathogenesis of increased cardiovascular risk in patients with gout; removing monosodium urate crystals or blocking the inflammatory pathway could reduce this excess risk. Accordingly, data for CMR outcomes with these urate-lowering or anti-inflammatory therapies in patients with gout are needed. In the meantime, highly pleiotropic CMR and urate-lowering benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and key lifestyle measures could play an important role in comorbidity care, in conjunction with effective gout care based on target serum urate concentrations according to the latest guidelines.",2021/12/19 06:00,10.1038/s41584-021-00725-9 [pii] and 10.1038/s41584-021-00725-9 [doi],34921301,101500080,United States,10.1038/s41584-021-00725-9 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20211217,Â© 2021.

New interventions for DKD management have been established in recent years, unleashing a novel paradigm, in which kidney-dedicated trials yield informative and robust data to guide optimal clinical management. After unprecedented results from groundbreaking randomized controlled trials were released, a new scenario of evidence-based recommendations has evolved for the management of diabetic patients with CKD. The current guidelines place great emphasis on multidimensional and interdisciplinary approaches, but the challenges of implementation are just starting and will be pivotal to optimize clinical results and to understand the new threshold for residual risk in DKD. We thereby provide an updated review on recent advances in DKD management based on new guideline recommendations, summarizing recent evidence while projecting the landscape for innovative ongoing initiatives in the field. Specifically, we review current insights on the natural history, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and therapeutics of DKD, mapping the new scientific information into the recently released Kidney Disease - Improving Global Outcomes Guidelines translating results from major novel randomized controlled trials to the clinical practice. Additionally, we approach the landscape of new therapeutics in the field, summarizing ongoing phase IIb and III trials focused on DKD. Finally, reflecting on the past and looking into the future, we highlight unmet needs in the current DKD management based on real-world evidence and offer a nephrologist's perspective into the challenge of fostering continuous improvement on clinical and patient-reported outcomes for individuals living with DKD.",2021/12/17 06:00,10.1111/joim.13424 [doi],34914852,8904841,England,10.1111/joim.13424 [doi],*chronic kidney disease and *clinical outcomes and *diabetes mellitus and *diabetic kidney disease,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20211222,Â© 2021 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Conversely, infection is the second most common cause of death in patients with kidney disease. However, little is known about the underlying secondary immunodeficiency related to kidney disease (SIDKD). In contrast to cardiovascular disease related to kidney disease, which has triggered countless epidemiologic, clinical, and experimental research activities or interventional trials, investments in tracing, understanding, and therapeutically targeting SIDKD have been sparse. As a call for more awareness of SIDKD as an imminent unmet medical need that requires rigorous research activities at all levels, we review the epidemiology of SIDKD and the numerous aspects of the abnormal immunophenotype of patients with kidney disease.

However, patients with normoalbuminuria can also progress to kidney failure. TNF receptor-1, TNF receptor-2, and kidney injury marker-1 (KIM-1) are known to be associated with kidney disease progression in patients with micro- or macroalbuminuria. We assessed the value of TNF receptor-1, TNF receptor-2, and KIM-1 as prognostic biomarkers for CKD progression in patients with type 2 diabetes and normoalbuminuria. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: TNF receptor-1, TNF receptor-2, and KIM-1 were measured using immunoassays in plasma samples from patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk participating in the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study trial. We used multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards analyses to estimate hazard ratios per doubling of each biomarker for the kidney outcome, stratified the population by the fourth quartile of each biomarker distribution, and assessed the number of events and event rates. RESULTS: In patients with normoalbuminuria (n=2553), 51 kidney outcomes were recorded during a median follow-up of 6.1 (interquartile range, 5.8-6.4) years (event rate, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 2.6 to 4.6 per 1000 patient-years). Each doubling of baseline TNF receptor-1 (hazard ratio, 4.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.8 to 9.6) and TNF receptor-2 (hazard ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 3.6) was associated with a higher risk for the kidney outcome. Baseline KIM-1, urinary albumin-creatinine ratio, and eGFR were not associated with kidney outcomes. The event rates in the highest quartile of TNF receptor-1 (â‰¥2992 ng/ml) and TNF receptor-2 (â‰¥11,394 ng/ml) were 5.6 and 7.0 events per 1000 patient-years, respectively, compared with 2.8 and 2.3, respectively, in the lower three quartiles. CONCLUSIONS: TNF receptor-1 and TNF receptor-2 are associated with kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and normoalbuminuria.

Its incidence is variable according to the studies. It is considered to occur in more than 50Â % of patients. Acute kidney injury is responsible for an increase in morbidity (length of hospitalization, renal replacement therapy) but also for excess mortality. The commonly accepted definition of acute kidney injury comes from the collaborative workgroup named Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO). It made it possible to standardize practices and raise awareness among practitioners about monitoring plasma creatinine and also diuresis. Acute kidney injury in intensive care unit is a systemic disease including circulatory, endothelial, epithelial and cellular function involvement and an acute kidney injury is not accompanied by ad integrum repair. After prolonged injury, inadequate repair begins with a fibrotic process. Several mechanisms are involved (cell cycle arrest, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, mitochondrial dysfunction) and result in improper repair. A continuum exists between acute kidney disease and chronic kidney disease, characterized by different renal recovery phenotypes. Thus, preventive measures to prevent the occurrence of kidney damage play a major role in management.

METHODS: Adult survivors of an AMI were retrospectively identified from the 2014 US Nationwide Readmissions Database. The impact of DM on the risk for a 6-month HFH was studied in subgroups of RFs using multivariable logistic regression to adjust for baseline risk differences. Individual interactions of DM with RFs were tested. RESULTS: Of 237,549 AMI survivors, 37.2% patients had DM. Primary outcome occurred in 12,934 patients (5.4%), at a 106% higher rate in DM patients (7.9% vs 4.0%, pÂ <Â 0.001), which was attenuated to a 45% higher adjusted risk. Higher HFH risk in DM patients was consistent across subgroups and significant interactions were present between DM and other RFs. The increased HFH risk with DM was more pronounced in patients without certain HF RFs compared with those with these RFs [ageÂ <Â 65: OR for DM 1.84 (1.58-2.13) vs ageÂ â‰¥Â 65: OR 1.34 (1.24-1.45); HF absent during index AMI: OR for DM 1.87 (1.66-2.10) vs HF present: OR 1.24 (1.14-1.34); atrial fibrillation absent: OR for DM 1.57 (1.46-1.68) vs present: OR 1.19 (1.06-1.33); P(interaction)Â <Â 0.001 for all]. Similar results were noted for hypertension and chronic kidney disease. CONCLUSIONS: AMI survivors with DM had a higher risk of 6-month HFHs. The impact of DM on the increased HFH risk was more pronounced in patients without certain RFs suggesting that more aggressive preventive strategies related to DM and HF are needed in these subgroups to prevent or delay the onset of HFHs.",2022/01/27 06:00,S0167-5273(21)01976-8 [pii] and 10.1016/j.ijcard.2021.11.086 [doi],34864085,8200291,Netherlands,S0167-5273(21)01976-8 [pii] and 10.1016/j.ijcard.2021.11.086 [doi],Acute myocardial infarction and Diabetes mellitus and Heart failure and Outcomes and Risk factors,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,20220126,Adult and *Cardiovascular Diseases and *Diabetes Mellitus/diagnosis/epidemiology and Heart Disease Risk Factors and *Heart Failure/diagnosis/epidemiology and Hospitalization and Humans and *Myocardial Infarction/diagnosis/epidemiology and Retrospective Studies and Risk Factors,NA,NA,NA,20211202,Copyright Â© 2021.

Elevated serum indoxyl sulfate levels are associated with poor skeletal muscle conditions. We aimed to determine the effects of AST-120, the oral adsorbent of indoxyl sulfate, on sarcopenia and sarcopenia-associated factors in chronic kidney disease patients. METHODS: This was a 48Â week, randomized controlled, parallel group, open-label, multicentre trial (nÂ =Â 150). The participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the control (CON) and AST-120 (RenamezinÂ®, REN) groups. Outcome measurements were performed at baseline and every 24Â weeks for 48Â weeks. The primary outcome was gait speed difference â‰¥0.1Â m/s between the two groups, and secondary outcomes included hand grip strength, muscle mass, and health-related quality of life. RESULTS: A difference of gait speed â‰¥0.1Â m/s was not observed during the study period. The mean dynamic-start gait speed in the REN group increased from baseline to 48Â weeks (1.04Â Â±Â 0.31 to 1.08Â Â±Â 0.32Â m/s, PÂ =Â 0.019). The static-start gait speed changed by -0.024 and 0.04Â m/s (PÂ =Â 0.049) in the CON and REN groups over 48Â weeks, respectively. Hand grip strength decreased during the first 24Â weeks and did not significantly change over the next 24Â weeks in either group. The proportion of low muscle mass or sarcopenia at baseline was larger in the REN group than in the CON group, but the difference attenuated over the study period [low muscle mass and sarcopenia in the CON and REN groups at baseline, 4.0% vs. 18.9% (PÂ =Â 0.004) and 2.7% vs. 13.5% (PÂ =Â 0.017); at 24Â weeks, 2.9% vs. 13.6% (PÂ =Â 0.021) and 1.4% vs. 10.5% (PÂ =Â 0.029); and at 48Â weeks, 7.6% vs. 12.9% (PÂ =Â 0.319) and 4.5% vs. 8.1% (PÂ =Â 0.482), respectively]. Bodily pain, vitality, symptoms/problems, and cognitive function in the REN group improved, while the quality of social interactions and the kidney disease effects in the CON group aggravated from baseline to 48Â weeks. Interaction between time and group was evident only in symptoms/problems, cognitive function, and kidney disease effects. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of AST-120 to standard treatment in chronic kidney disease patients did not make a significant difference in gait speed, although AST-120 modestly had beneficial effects on gait speed change and quality of life and showed the potential to improve sarcopenia.

In secondary analyses, trials have shown consistent reductions in macroalbuminuria, but inconclusive results about kidney function decline. To help clarify this, we conducted a cohort study to compare kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in individuals who started GLP1-RA or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) (reduces degradation of endogenous GLP1). The primary outcome was a composite of sustained doubling of creatinine, kidney failure or kidney death. The secondary outcomes were three-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and its individual components. Propensity score weighted Cox regression was used to balance 53 confounders. A total of 19,766 individuals were included, of whom 5,699 initiated GLP1-RA, and were followed for a median 2.9 years. Mean age was 63 years, 26.2% had atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and 16.0% had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) under 60 ml/min/1.73m(2). The adjusted hazard ratio for GLP1-RA vs. DPP4i was 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.53-0.98) for the composite kidney outcome and 0.85 (0.73-0.99) for MACE, with absolute five-year risk reductions of 0.8% (0.1%-1.5%) and 1.6% (0.2%-2.9%), respectively. Hazard ratios were 0.79 (0.60-1.05) for cardiovascular death, 0.86 (0.68-1.09) for myocardial infarction and 0.74 (0.59-0.93) for stroke. Results were consistent within subgroups, including age, sex, eGFR and baseline metformin use. Thus, in our analysis of patients from routine clinical practice, the use of GLP1-RA was associated with a lower risk of kidney outcomes compared with DPP4i. Reductions in both kidney outcomes and MACE were similar in magnitude to those reported in large cardiovascular outcome trials.",2021/11/27 06:00,S0085-2538(21)01065-6 [pii] and 10.1016/j.kint.2021.10.033 [doi],34826514,0323470,United States,S0085-2538(21)01065-6 [pii] and 10.1016/j.kint.2021.10.033 [doi],MACE and chronic kidney disease progression and diabetes mellitus and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20211124,Copyright Â© 2021 International Society of Nephrology.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between CKD and the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) along with mortality as a competing risk in general population cohorts. We also included an assessment of baseline biomarkers of inflammation, myocardial injury, and left ventricular dysfunction with risk of AF and HF, respectively, to shed light on the potential underlying pathophysiology. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study was conducted within the BiomarCaRE project using harmonized data from 12 European population-based cohorts (nÂ =Â 48Â 518 participants). Renal function was assessed by glomerular filtration rate estimated using the combined Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation with standardized serum creatinine (Cr) and non-standardized serum cystatin C (CysC). Incidence of AF and HF respectively, during a median follow-up of 8Â years was recorded. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine hazard ratios (HRs) for the incidence of AF and HF in CKD and the competing risk of mortality after adjustment for covariates. The mean age at baseline was 51.4 (standard deviation 12.1) years, 49% were men. Overall, 4.3% of subjects had CKD at baseline. The rate for AF was 3.8 per 1000 person-years during follow-up. The HR for AF in patients with CKD compared with patients without CKD was 1.28 (95% confidence interval 1.07-1.54) after adjustment for covariates. The rate for incident HF was 4.1 per 1000 person-years and the HR of CKD for HF was 1.71 (95% confidence interval 1.45-2.01. In subjects with CKD, N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) showed an association with AF, whereas NT-proBNP and C-reactive protein were associated with HF. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic kidney disease is an independent risk factor for subsequent AF and is even more closely associated with HF. In these relatively young participants with CKD, NT-proBNP was strongly associated with subsequent risk of AF. For HF, in addition, elevated levels of hs-C-reactive protein at baseline were related to incident events.",2021/11/27 06:00,EHF213699 [pii] and 10.1002/ehf2.13699 [doi],34825788,101669191,NA,10.1002/ehf2.13699 [doi],Atrial fibrillation and Biomarkers and Chronic kidney disease and Cohort study and General population and Heart failure,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,PMC8788046,NA,"All authors have completed the ICMJE uniform disclosure form online and (www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf) and declare no support from any organization for and the submitted work; no financial relationships with any organizations that might and have an interest in the submitted work in the previous three years; no other and relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work. and Outside the submitted work, S.B. reports personal fees from Lumira Diagnostics, and ThermoFisher, Siemens, Abbott Diagnostics, Roche Diagnostics, and grants from and ThermoFisher, Siemens, and Abbott Diagnostics.

Data regarding transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in these patients are limited. Herein, we aim to investigate TAVI outcomes in patients with ESKD and CKD. We analyzed clinical data of patients with ESKD and CKD who underwent TAVI from 2008 to 2018 in a large urban healthcare system. Patients' demographics were compared, and significant morbidity and mortality outcomes were noted. Multivariable analyses were used to adjust for potential baseline variables. A total of 643 patients with CKD underwent TAVI with an overall in-hospital mortality of 5.1%, whereas 84 patients with ESKD underwent TAVI with an overall mortality rate of 11.9%. The most frequently observed comorbidities in patients with CKD were heart failure, atrial fibrillation (AF), mitral stenosis (MS), pulmonary hypertension, and chronic lung disease. After multivariable analysis, MS (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.92; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 to 11.1, p <0.05) and AF (adjusted OR 2.42; 95% CI 1.3 to 4.4 p <0.05) were independently associated with mortality in patients with CKD.

METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 6189 adult treatment-naÃ¯ve CHB patients initiated therapy with TDF (nâ€‰=â€‰2482) or ETV (nâ€‰=â€‰3707) at 25 international centers using multivariable generalized linear modeling (GLM) to determine mean eGFR (mL/min/1.73Â m(2)) and Kaplan-Meier method to estimate incidence of renal impairment (â‰¥â€‰1 chronic kidney disease [CKD] stage worsening). We also examined above renal changes in matched ETV and TDF patients (via propensity score matching [PSM] on age, sex, diabetes mellitus [DM], hypertension [HTN], cirrhosis, baseline eGFR, and follow-up duration). RESULTS: In the overall cohort (mean age 49.7Â years, 66.2% male), the baseline eGFR was higher for TDF vs. ETV group (75.9 vs. 74.0, pâ€‰=â€‰0.009). PSM yielded 1871 pairs of ETV or TDF patients with baseline eGFRâ€‰â‰¥â€‰60 and 520 pairs for the eGFRâ€‰<â€‰60 group. GLM analysis of the overall (unmatched) cohort and PSM cohorts revealed lower adjusted mean eGFRs in TDF (vs. ETV) patients (all pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) during 10Â years of follow-up. Among PSM eGFRâ€‰â‰¥â€‰60 patients, the 5-year cumulative incidences of renal impairment were 42.64% for ETV and 48.03% for TDF (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0023).

Yet, kidney researchers and clinicians have struggled to fully explain or rectify causes of these inequalities. Many studies have sought to identify hypothesized genetic and/or ancestral origins of biologic or behavioral deficits as singular explanations for racial and ethnic inequalities in kidney health. However, these approaches reinforce essentialist beliefs that racial groups are inherently biologically and behaviorally different. These approaches also often conflate the complex interactions of individual-level biologic differences with aggregated population-level disparities that are due to structural racism (i.e., sociopolitical policies and practices that created and perpetuate harmful health outcomes through inequities of opportunities and resources).

While cardiovascular outcomes of diabetes are improving over time, diabetic kidney disease (DKD) still leads to an exceedingly high rate of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). A game-changing opportunity is offered by treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have indisputably shown that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the rate of DKD progression, the decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and the development of ESKD. In parallel, SGLT2 inhibitors improve cardiovascular outcomes, especially the risk of hospitalization for heart failure. Real-world studies (RWSs) have largely confirmed the findings of RCTs in broader populations of subjects with T2D followed under routine care. In the present paper, we review RWSs exploring the renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and highlight the most critical challenges that can be encountered in designing and conducting such studies. Channelling bias (confounding by indication), time-lag bias, conditioning on the future, database heterogeneity, linearity of eGFR change over time, and duration of observation are critical issues that may undermine the robustness of RWS findings. We then elaborate on the new opportunities to overcome such limitations by describing the design and objectives of the DARWIN (DApagliflozin Real-World evIdeNce)-Renal study, a new RWS promoted by the Italian Diabetes Society. Fine-tuning of methods for comparative observational research will improve evidence derived from RWSs on the renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, aiding the evolving discussion regarding the place of SGLT2 inhibitors in T2D treatment algorithms in different stages of DKD.",2021/11/09 06:00,10.1111/dom.14599 [doi],34747123,100883645,England,10.1111/dom.14599 [doi],effectiveness and kidney disease and observational and pharmacoepidemiology and slope,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20211124,"Â© 2021 The Authors.

Prediabetes may already be associated with an increased risk of chronic 'diabetes-related' complications. This umbrella review aimed to provide a systematic overview of the available evidence from meta-analyses of prospective observational studies on the associations between prediabetes and incident diabetes-related complications in adults and to evaluate their strength and certainty. METHODS: For this umbrella review, systematic reviews with meta-analyses reporting summary risk estimates for the associations between prediabetes (based on fasting or 2Â h postload glucose or on HbA(1c)) and incidence of diabetes-related complications, comorbidities and mortality risk were included. PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library and Epistemonikos were searched up to 17 June 2021. Summary risk estimates were recalculated using a random effects model. The certainty of evidence was evaluated by applying the GRADE tool. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020153227. RESULTS: Ninety-five meta-analyses from 16 publications were identified. In the general population, prediabetes was associated with a 6-101% increased risk for all-cause mortality and the incidence of cardiovascular outcomes, CHD, stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease, as well as total cancer, total liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer and all-cause dementia with moderate certainty of evidence. No associations between prediabetes and incident depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment were observed (with low or very low certainty of evidence). The association with all-cause mortality was stronger for prediabetes defined by impaired glucose tolerance than for prediabetes defined by HbA(1c). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Prediabetes was positively associated with risk of all-cause mortality and the incidence of cardiovascular outcomes, CHD, stroke, chronic kidney disease, cancer and dementia.

METHODS: A population-based observational retrospective study was conducted using a Portuguese administrative database containing all mainland public hospitalizations. From 2008-2015, hospitalization episodes with a primary diagnosis of BD were analysed. Outcomes included: length of stay (LoS), in-hospital mortality and discharge destination. RESULTS: Overall, 20807 hospitalization episodes were analysed. MeanÂ±standard deviation age at admission was 47.9Â±14.3 years, and these episodes mostly refer to women's admissions (66.6%). Median (1st quartile; 3rd quartile) LoS was 16.0 (9.0; 25.0) days. A total of 2145 (10.3%) episodes had â‰¥1 CCI comorbidities registered, being diabetes the most prevalent. LoS was significantly higher for episodes with secondary diagnoses of congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, dementia, diabetes, renal disease and malignancy (all p<0.05). Episodes with a registry of myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, malignancy and renal disease diagnoses had higher in-hospital mortality. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include the use of data registered for administrative reasons rather than research purposes, and the analysis of hospitalization episodes, instead of patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this Portuguese nationwide study, greater comorbidity had a measurable impact on BD hospitalization outcomes. During the study period the prevalence of CCI comorbidities rose from 8.1% to 17.4%, which may reflect the overall increasing quality of hospital-coded data in Portugal throughout the years.

Urinary biomarkers have been associated with adverse kidney outcomes in other settings and may provide additional prognostic information in patients with COVID-19. We investigated the association between urinary biomarkers and adverse kidney outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (n=153) at 2 academic medical centers between April and JuneÂ 2020. EXPOSURE: 19 urinary biomarkers of injury, inflammation, and repair. OUTCOME: Composite of KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) stage 3 AKI, requirement for dialysis, or death within 60 days of hospital admission. We also compared various kidney biomarker levels in the setting of COVID-19 versus other common AKI settings. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Time-varying Cox proportional hazards regression to associate biomarker level with composite outcome. RESULTS: Out of 153 patients, 24 (15.7%) experienced the primary outcome. Twofold higher levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) (HR, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.14-1.57]), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) (HR, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.09-1.84]), and kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1) (HR, 2.03 [95% CI, 1.38-2.99]) were associated with highest risk of sustaining primary composite outcome. Higher epidermal growth factor (EGF) levels were associated with a lower risk of the primary outcome (HR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.47-0.79]). Individual biomarkers provided moderate discrimination and biomarker combinations improved discrimination for the primary outcome. The degree of kidney injury by biomarker level in COVID-19 was comparable to other settings of clinical AKI. There was evidence of subclinical AKI in COVID-19 patients based on elevated injury biomarker level in patients without clinical AKI defined by serum creatinine. LIMITATIONS: Small sample size with low number of composite outcome events.

It is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Our aim is to determine the inpatient outcomes of liver transplant patients with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) and trends in the last few years. METHODS: We utilized the national re-admission data (2010-2017) to study the outcomes of CDI in liver transplant patients. Association of C. difficile with re-admission was computed in a multivariable model adjusted for age, sex, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, obesity, cancer, insurance, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, peripheral vascular disease, smoking, hospital location, and teaching status. RESULTS: During 2010-2017, there were 310Â 222 liver transplant patients hospitalized. Out of these, 9826 had CDI. CDI infection in liver transplant patients was associated with higher 30-day re-admission (14.3% vs. 11.21%, hazard ratio [HR]: 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.28, pÂ =Â .02) and in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.14-1.61, pÂ <Â .001). The most common causes of re-admission in the CDI group were recurrent CDI (41.1%), liver transplant complications (16.5%), and sepsis (11.6%). The median cost for liver transplant patients with C. difficile was significantly higher, $53Â 064 (IQR $24Â 970-$134Â 830) compared to patients that did not have C. difficile, $35Â 703 ($18Â 793-$73Â 871) (pÂ <Â .001). The median length of stay was also longer for patients with CDI, 6Â days (4-14) vs. 4Â days (2-7) (pÂ <Â .001). CONCLUSION: CDI in post-liver transplant patients was associated with higher mortality, re-admission, health care cost, and longer length of stay. The most common cause of re-admission was recurrent CDI, which raises the question of the efficacy of standard first-line therapy.",2022/02/10 06:00,10.1111/tid.13750 [doi],34695277,100883688,Denmark,10.1111/tid.13750 [doi],Clostridioides difficile infection and immunosuppression and liver transplant,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,20220209,*Clostridioides difficile and *Clostridium Infections/epidemiology and Humans and Inpatients and *Liver Transplantation/adverse effects and Retrospective Studies and Risk Factors,NA,NA,NA,20211103,Â© 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Epub 2021 Oct 14.,79,1615-5947 (Electronic) and 0890-5096 (Linking),56-64,"BACKGROUND: Patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) present with claudication or chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI). CLTI patients have a more advanced stage of atherosclerosis and increased comorbidities compared to claudicants, and are at an elevated risk of major amputation and mortality after lower extremity revascularization (LER). However, the frequency of reinterventions for claudication and CLTI have not been compared. Our hypothesis is that patients with CLTI undergo more frequent reinterventions to prevent major amputation. METHODS: A single-center retrospective chart review of consecutive patients undergoing lower extremity revascularization (LER) for PAD in 2013-2015 was performed. Patients were stratified based on indication for revascularization into claudication or CLTI. Patient characteristics, outcomes, and reinterventions were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: There were 826 patients undergoing LER and 44% (NÂ =Â 361) had CLTI. Patients treated for CLTI were more likely to be smokers (P < 0.001), to have diabetes (P< 0.001), chronic renal insufficiency (P< 0.001), end stage renal disease (P< 0.001), and cardiac disease (P< 0.001). CLTI patients were less likely to be on optimal medical management as reflected by decreased rate of aspirin (P< 0.001), ADP receptor/P2Y12 inhibitors (P< 0.001), and statins (P< 0.001) compared to patients with claudication. Patients with CLTI had significantly higher major amputation (3.7% vs. 0.2%, P< 0.001) and mortality (1.4% vs. 0.2%, P = 0.092) at 30 days. At long-term follow up, patients with CLTI had higher rates of major amputation (15.5% vs. 1.3%, P < 0.001) and mortality (37.1% vs. 18.1%, P < 0.001) compared to patients with claudication. There was a significant difference in mean follow-up time between the 2 cohorts (claudication: 3.7 Â± 1.5 years versus CLTI: 2.6 Â± 1.8 years, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the ipsilateral reintervention rate between the 2 groups (claudication: 39.6% vs. CLTI: 42.7%, P = 0.37) or the mean number of ipsilateral reinterventions (claudication: 2.0 Â± 1.6 vs. CLTI: 2.0 Â± 1.7). However, after adjusting for follow-up time, the mean number of reinterventions per year was significantly higher for CLTI patients compared to patients with claudication (1.4 Â± 2.2 vs. .6 Â± 0.7 intervention per year, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing LER for CLTI undergo more frequent reinterventions over time compared to patients treated for claudication. Research on reinterventions after LER should include reporting of the frequency of reintervention adjusted for the follow up period in addition to the reintervention rate defined as the percentage of patients undergoing reintervention.",2021/10/18 06:00,S0890-5096(21)00715-9 [pii] and 10.1016/j.avsg.2021.07.050 [doi],34656724,8703941,Netherlands,S0890-5096(21)00715-9 [pii] and 10.1016/j.avsg.2021.07.050 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20211014,Published by Elsevier Inc.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is the first study investigating possible sex differences in prevalence, control and phenotypes of hypertension in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with office-BP and 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 136 male and 69 female stable KTRs who underwent office-BP measurements and 24-h ABPM. Hypertension thresholds for office and ambulatory BP were defined according to the 2017 ACC/AHA and 2021 KDIGO guidelines for KTRs. RESULTS: Age, time from transplantation, eGFR and history of major comorbidities did not differ between groups. Office SBP/DBP levels were insignificantly higher in men than women (130.3â€ŠÂ±â€Š16.3/77.3â€ŠÂ±â€Š9.4 vs. 126.4â€ŠÂ±â€Š17.8/74.9â€ŠÂ±â€Š11.5â€ŠmmHg; Pâ€Š=â€Š0.118/0.104) but daytime SBP/DBP was significantly higher in men (128.5â€ŠÂ±â€Š12.1/83.0â€ŠÂ±â€Š8.2 vs. 124.6â€ŠÂ±â€Š11.9/80.3â€ŠÂ±â€Š9.3â€ŠmmHg; Pâ€Š=â€Š0.032/Pâ€Š=â€Š0.044). No significant between-group differences were detected for night-time BP. The prevalence of hypertension was similar by office-BP criteria (93.4 vs. 91.3%; Pâ€Š=â€Š0.589), but higher in men than women with ABPM (100 vs. 95.7%; Pâ€Š=â€Š0.014). The use of ACEIs/ARBs and CCBs was more common in men. Office-BP control was similar (43.3 vs. 44.4%, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.882), but 24-h control was significantly lower in men than women (16.9 vs. 30.3%; Pâ€Š=â€Š0.029).

Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), the only potentially curative treatment for the hematological complications of FA, may precipitate acute kidney injury (AKI) and hypertension. We retrospectively investigated 107 FA patients who underwent HCT between 2009 and 2017. We investigated the incidence and risk factors of AKI within 100 days after HCT in a cohort of FA patients, and kidney function and hypertension over 2-year follow-up.The incidence of AKI (mainly stage I) was 18.7%. Patients aged â‰¥ 11 years at transplantation showed a higher risk of AKI (OR 3.53). The eGFR was 60-90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) in 53 (49.5%), 55 (51.4%), 50 (50.5%), 50 (51%), and 46 (59.7%) patients before HCT, at 100 days, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. Within the first 100 days after HCT, hypertension was observed in 72% of the patients and was associated with cyclosporine therapy. Most (62.3%) patients had stage 2 hypertension. CAKUT was observed in 33.7% of the patients and was associated with both hypertension (86%) and diminished kidney function but not with AKI.Conlusion: Although AKI, a commonly known HCT complication, was mild in this study, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), as well as the high incidence of hypertension, specially associated with CAKUT point out the importance of kidney care in short and long-term follow up of FA patients. What is Known: â€¢ Fanconi anemia (FA) is the most frequent inherited bone marrow failure in children, and 30% of cases have congenital anomalies of kidney (CAKUT). â€¢ Acute kidney injury and hypertension after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) may impact the outcomes.. What is New: â€¢ Despite the presence of CAKUT and stage 2 CKD in 33.7% and 50% of the patients, respectively, AKI was mild and transitory after HCT in FA patients. â€¢ CAKUT in FA patients was associated with lower kidney function and hypertension after HCT.",2022/02/10 06:00,10.1007/s00431-021-04263-0 [pii] and 10.1007/s00431-021-04263-0 [doi],34553252,7603873,Germany,10.1007/s00431-021-04263-0 [doi],Acute kidney injury and CAKUT and Fanconi anemia and Hematopoietic cell transplantation and Hypertension,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,20220209,*Acute Kidney Injury/epidemiology/etiology and Child and *Fanconi Anemia/complications/epidemiology/therapy and *Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects and Humans and Kidney and Retrospective Studies,NA,NA,NA,20210922,"Â© 2021.

We aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of remdesivir plus standard of care compared with standard of care alone in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, with indication of oxygen or ventilator support. METHODS: DisCoVeRy was a phase 3, open-label, adaptive, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial conducted in 48 sites in Europe (France, Belgium, Austria, Portugal, Luxembourg). Adult patients (aged â‰¥18 years) admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and illness of any duration were eligible if they had clinical evidence of hypoxaemic pneumonia, or required oxygen supplementation. Exclusion criteria included elevated liver enzymes, severe chronic kidney disease, any contraindication to one of the studied treatments or their use in the 29 days before random assignment, or use of ribavirin, as well as pregnancy or breastfeeding. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) to receive standard of care alone or in combination with remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir, lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon beta-1a, or hydroxychloroquine. Randomisation used computer-generated blocks of various sizes; it was stratified on severity of disease at inclusion and on European administrative region. Remdesivir was administered as 200 mg intravenous infusion on day 1, followed by once daily, 1-h infusions of 100 mg up to 9 days, for a total duration of 10 days. It could be stopped after 5 days if the participant was discharged. The primary outcome was the clinical status at day 15 measured by the WHO seven-point ordinal scale, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population and was one of the secondary outcomes. This trial is registered with the European Clinical Trials Database, EudraCT2020-000936-23, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04315948. FINDINGS: Between March 22, 2020, and Jan 21, 2021, 857 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to remdesivir plus standard of care (n=429) or standard of care only (n=428). 15 participants were excluded from analysis in the remdesivir group, and ten in the control group. At day 15, the distribution of the WHO ordinal scale was: (1) not hospitalised, no limitations on activities (61 [15%] of 414 in the remdesivir group vs 73 [17%] of 418 in the control group); (2) not hospitalised, limitation on activities (129 [31%] vs 132 [32%]); (3) hospitalised, not requiring supplemental oxygen (50 [12%] vs 29 [7%]); (4) hospitalised, requiring supplemental oxygen (76 [18%] vs 67 [16%]); (5) hospitalised, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices (15 [4%] vs 14 [3%]); (6) hospitalised, on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (62 [15%] vs 79 [19%]); (7) death (21 [5%] vs 24 [6%]). The difference between treatment groups was not significant (odds ratio 0Â·98 [95% CI 0Â·77-1Â·25]; p=0Â·85). There was no significant difference in the occurrence of serious adverse events between treatment groups (remdesivir, 135 [33%] of 406 vs control, 130 [31%] of 418; p=0Â·48). Three deaths (acute respiratory distress syndrome, bacterial infection, and hepatorenal syndrome) were considered related to remdesivir by the investigators, but only one by the sponsor's safety team (hepatorenal syndrome). INTERPRETATION: No clinical benefit was observed from the use of remdesivir in patients who were admitted to hospital for COVID-19, were symptomatic for more than 7 days, and required oxygen support.

This disease has been most frequently studied in Caucasians. We studied a group in Southern California where the Hispanics make up half of the population. We believe there will be different phenotypes between the two. METHODS: A retrospective study of 114 patients was conducted at two tertiary care centers between 2003 and 2019. Demographic data, ICU admission, ANCA antibody status, BVAS on presentation, VDI per the last clinic visit, the number of hospitalizations, the number of follow-up years, and treatment were recorded. We calculated odds ratios for the categorical data and ran independent sample T test for the continuous data with alpha equal to 0.05 for statistical significance. RESULTS: Difference was found in antibody status, disease presentation, morbidity, and age at diagnosis. Hispanics had greater number of AAV flares despite BVAS and VDI being comparable. Caucasians had more frequent follow-up. Hispanics had a 4.39 increase in odds of being admitted to the ICU, a 1.33 increased odds of developing acute respiratory failure, and a 67% increased odds of developing hemoptysis or pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage. Further, Hispanics had a 1.22 increase in odds of having ESRD. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians treating Hispanic patients with AAV should have a high index of suspicion for severe disease in this patient population. Further, epidemiologic and disparities research should be conducted to evaluate the discrepancy in outcomes in these groups. Key Points â€¢ This is the first study to examine the phenotype and severity of ANCA associated vasculitis in Southern California, a population which is comprised largely of Hispanics. â€¢ Hispanics in this population were found to be more likely to be admitted to the ICU, have more flares, reach end-stage renal disease, have severe pulmonary manifestations, and had fewer outpatient follow-up visits than their Caucasian counterparts. â€¢ Clinicians should have a high suspicion for more severe disease in Hispanics in this region when compared to Caucasians. â€¢ More research is needed to assess the degree social determinants of health contribute to these findings and if progress can be made with decreasing health disparities between these populations in this disease.",2022/01/27 06:00,10.1007/s10067-021-05916-z [pii] and 10.1007/s10067-021-05916-z [doi],34518974,8211469,Germany,10.1007/s10067-021-05916-z [doi],ANCA vasculitis and Health disparities and Southern California,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,20220125,"*Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis/epidemiology and Antibodies, Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic and California/epidemiology and Hispanic or Latino and Humans and Retrospective Studies and Whites",NA,"0 (Antibodies, Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic)",NA,20210914,Â© 2021.

We characterized the humoral response after 3 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine in patients treated with either maintenance hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD). STUDY DESIGN: Case series. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 69 French patients (38 HD and 31 PD) treated at a single center who received 3 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. FINDINGS: Humoral response was evaluated using plasma levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 immunoglobulin measured after the second dose and at least 3 weeks after the third dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Patients (median age 68 years [interquartile range (IQR), 53-76 years], 65% men) had a median anti-S1 antibody level of 284 [IQR, 83-1190] AU/mL after the second dose, and 7,554 [IQR, 2,268-11,736] AU/mL after the third dose. Three patients were nonresponders (anti-S1 antibody levelÂ < 0.8 AU/mL), and 12 were weak responders (anti-S1 antibody level 0.8-50 AU/mL) after the second vaccine dose. After the third dose, 1 of the 3 initial nonresponders produced anti-spike antibody, and all the 12 initial weak responders increased their antibody levels. Patients with a greater increase in anti-S1 antibody levels after a third dose had lower antibody levels after the second dose, and a longer time interval between the second and the third dose. Adverse events did not seem to be more common or severe after a third vaccine dose. LIMITATIONS: Observational study, small sample size. Relationship between antibody levels and clinical outcomes is not well understood. CONCLUSIONS: A third dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine substantially increased antibody levels in patients receiving maintenance dialysis and appeared to be as well tolerated as a second dose.",2022/01/29 06:00,S0272-6386(21)00833-7 [pii] and 10.1053/j.ajkd.2021.08.005 [doi],34508833,8110075,NA,S0272-6386(21)00833-7 [pii] and 10.1053/j.ajkd.2021.08.005 [doi],*Antibody levels and *BNT162b2 and *anti-spike serology and *coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and *dialysis and *end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and *immune response and *severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and *third booster dose and *vaccine and *vaccine adverse effects,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,20220128,Aged and Antibody Formation and BNT162 Vaccine and *COVID-19 and COVID-19 Vaccines and Female and Humans and Male and *Peritoneal Dialysis and Renal Dialysis and SARS-CoV-2,PMC8425695,0 (COVID-19 Vaccines) and N38TVC63NU (BNT162 Vaccine),NA,20210908,"Copyright Â© 2021 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

Calciphylaxis typically occurs in the setting of end-stage renal disease with secondary hyperparathyroidism and elevated calcium-phosphorus product. The estimated incidence of calciphylaxis in dialysis or kidney transplant patients is 1 to 4%; however, the incidence of non-uremic calciphylaxis is unknown. We assessed postmarketing adverse event reports to further characterize cases of calciphylaxis associated with teriparatide. We searched for cases of teriparatide-associated calciphylaxis in the literature (EMBASE, PubMed) and those reported to FDA, including the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System, through March 31, 2021. We included calciphylaxis cases following teriparatide exposure ofâ€‰<â€‰2Â years. Twelve cases described teriparatide-associated calciphylaxis. The median age was 81 (range 47-86) years. Eleven cases reported confirmatory biopsy and/or imaging. The median time-to-onset of calciphylaxis following teriparatide initiation was 3.5 (range 1-20) months. Three cases reported hospitalization, of which one resulted in death due to progression of the lesions. All cases had multiple risk factors (mean (SD), 4.5 (1.0)) including concomitant medications associated with calciphylaxis (12), female sex (11), and/or underlying autoimmune disease or other inflammatory disorder (10). We believe that exposure to teriparatide, coupled with underlying risk factors, may have triggered new-onset calciphylaxis. Expedited diagnosis and management by a clinician are important because calciphylaxis may be life-threatening and early intervention may improve outcomes.",2022/02/08 06:00,10.1007/s00198-021-06139-3 [pii] and 10.1007/s00198-021-06139-3 [doi],34494145,9100105,NA,10.1007/s00198-021-06139-3 [doi],Calciphylaxis and Non-uremic and Osteoporosis and Teriparatide,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,20220207,"Aged and Aged, 80 and over and *Calciphylaxis/chemically induced and Endothelial Cells and Female and Humans and *Hyperparathyroidism, Secondary and *Kidney Failure, Chronic/complications and Middle Aged and Teriparatide/adverse effects",PMC8813882,10T9CSU89I (Teriparatide),Conflicts of interest None.,20210908,Â© 2021.

ESKD has a high prevalence in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). CKD increases the chances of hypoglycaemia by different mechanisms, causes insulin resistance and a decrease in insulin metabolism. Both the ""Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes"" (KDIGO) and ""American Diabetes Association"" (ADA) guidelines recommend the use of insulin as part of treatment, but the type of basal insulin is not specified. METHODS: We reviewed the literature to determine whether first- and second-generation basal insulins are effective and safe in CKD patients. We reviewed specific pivotal studies conducted by pharmaceutical laboratories, as well as independent studies. CONCLUSIONS: Basal insulins are safe and effective in patients with CKD and diabetes mellitus but we do not have specific studies. Given that CKD is one of the main complications of type 2 DM, and insulin specific treatment in the final stages, the absence of studies is striking. Real-life data are also important since trials such as pivotal studies do not fully represent actual patients.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective observational cohort study including a matched comparison group. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 1,285 living kidney donors from 7 tertiary hospitals between 2003 and 2016, and a matched comparison group consisting of the same number of health screening examinees with similar baseline clinical characteristics and socioeconomic status. All participants were receiving Korean national health insurance. EXPOSURE: Kidney donation as reflected in the Korean National Health Insurance System (NHIS) database. OUTCOME: Changes in household economic status estimated by Korean national health insurance fees and changes in employment status reflected in the NHIS database. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: The outcomes of the donor group and matched control group were compared annually using multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusted for clinical and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: The median ages of the donors and matched controls were 45 and 46 years, respectively; 44.6% of both groups were male. Compared to the comparison group, living donors were at higher risk of being unemployed or losing employment during the first 2 years after donation (eg, first-year loss of employment: odds ratio (OR), 2.27 [95% CI, 1.55-3.33]); however, this association did not persist. Donors also had a significantly lower odds of improvement in economic status (OR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.47-0.71]) and a higher odds of deterioration in financial status (OR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.23-1.93]) in the first year after transplantation and subsequently. LIMITATIONS: Unmeasured differences between donors and matched controls creating residual selection bias and confounding.

We investigated the association between deceased donor AKI assessed using back-estimation of baseline serum creatinine (Scr) and graft survival. STUDY DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients represented within the French CRISTAL registry who received a single kidney allograft from brain-dead deceased donors between January 2006 and DecemberÂ 2017. EXPOSURE: A back-estimated Scr baseline value was derived for an assumed glomerular filtration rate at 75mL/min/1.73m(2), using the MDRD Study equation. A refined classification system for donor AKI was implemented as follows: no AKI, undetermined AKI/chronic kidney disease (CKD), recovery from AKI, and ongoing AKI. OUTCOME: Death-censored graft survival. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Multivariable Cox models using a robust variance estimator for paired kidneys from the same donor. RESULTS: We classified 26,786 recipients as follows: no AKI (n=19,276); undetermined AKI/CKD (n=1,745); recovery from AKI (n=2,392); and ongoing AKI (n=3,373). We observed 4,458 kidney graft losses during a median follow-up period of 5.7 years. Compared with no AKI, ongoing AKI was associated with an increased risk of graft failure (hazard ratio [HR], 1.24 [95% CI, 1.13-1.35]). The HRs for graft failure in the undetermined AKI/CKD and recovery from AKI groups (1.22 [95% CI, 1.07-1.38] and 1.18 [95% CI, 1.06-1.31], respectively) were similar to those observed in the ongoing AKI group. The adverse effect of deceased donor AKI was no longer evident when relying either on the admission or the lowest Scr throughout the procurement procedure as baseline Scr. LIMITATIONS: No measurement of urine output in donors. CONCLUSIONS: Deceased donor ongoing AKI, undetermined AKI/CKD, and recovery from AKI according to back-estimated baseline Scr are associated with decreased graft survival. The definition of baseline Scr as the first value measured on admission would have led to a misclassification bias and erroneous estimates.",2022/02/03 06:00,S0272-6386(21)00770-8 [pii] and 10.1053/j.ajkd.2021.06.022 [doi],34416353,8110075,United States,S0272-6386(21)00770-8 [pii] and 10.1053/j.ajkd.2021.06.022 [doi],*Acute kidney failure and *acute kidney injury (AKI) and *clinical epidemiology and *graft survival and *kidney failure and *kidney transplantation and *organ discard and *renal function and *serum creatinine (Scr),NOTNLM,IM,NLM,20220202,*Acute Kidney Injury/diagnosis/epidemiology and Adult and Creatinine and Graft Survival and Humans and *Kidney Transplantation and Registries and Retrospective Studies and Tissue Donors,NA,AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine),NA,20210817,"Copyright Â© 2021 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

Despite evidence from the ASTRAL (2009) and CORAL (2013) randomized controlled trials showing that percutaneous renal artery revascularization did not improve major outcomes compared with best medical therapy alone over 3-5 years, several areas of uncertainty remain. Medical therapy, including statin and antihypertensive medications, has evolved in recent years, and the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers is now considered the primary means to treat hypertension in the setting of ARVD. However, the criteria to identify kidneys with renal artery stenosis that have potentially salvageable function are evolving. There are also data suggesting that certain high-risk populations with specific clinical manifestations may benefit from revascularization.

The present study evaluated the outcomes of COVID-19 patients who were overweight or obese and variables associated with severe disease in a large group of consecutive cases. METHODS: A nationwide retrospective cohort study was performed using the Turkish National Healthcare Database. Demographic characteristics, laboratory tests, comorbidities, and medications of patients registered between March 11 and May 30, 2020, were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 14,â€‰625 patients (median age:42, IQR:26 years; female 57.4%) with normal weight (34.7%), overweight (35.6%), and obesity (29.7%) were included.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the commonest end-organ manifestation of TMA. The epidemiology, diagnostic features, outcomes, and effectiveness of interventions including therapeutic plasma-exchange (TPE), in snakebite-associated TMA are poorly understood. METHODS: We reviewed all patients with suspected or confirmed snakebite recruited to the Australian Snakebite Project (2004-2018 inclusive), a prospective cohort study, from 202 participating Australian hospitals across the country. TMA was defined as anemia with schistocytosis. RESULTS: 2069 patients with suspected snakebite were enrolled, with 1158 (56.0%) systemically envenomed, of which 842 (72.7%) developed VICC, from which 104 (12.4%) developed TMA. Of those systemically envenomed, TMA occurred in 26% (13/50) taipan, 17% (60/351) brown, and 8% (16/197) tiger snakebites. Thrombocytopenia was present in 90% (94/104) of TMA cases, and a further eight (8%) had aâ€‰>â€‰25% decrease in platelets from the presentation. Patients with TMA were significantly older than non-TMA patients with VICC (53 [35-61] versus 41 [24-55] years, median [IQR], pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). AKI developed in 94% (98/104) of TMA patients, with 34% (33/98) requiring dialysis (D-AKI). There were four deaths. In D-AKI TMA cases, eventual dialysis-free survival (DFS) was 97% (32/33). TPE was used in five D-AKI cases, with no significant difference in DFS or time to independence from dialysis. >90-day follow-up for 25 D-AKI cases (130 person-years) showed no end-stage kidney disease but 52% (13/25) hadâ€‰â‰¥â€‰stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD). CONCLUSION: Our findings support a definition of snakebite-associated TMA as anemia with schistocytosis and either thrombocytopenia or >25% drop in platelet count. AKI occurring with snakebite-associated TMA varied in severity, with most achieving DFS, but with a risk of long-term CKD in half. We found no evidence of benefit for TPE in D-AKI.",2021/07/31 06:00,10.1080/15563650.2021.1948559 [doi],34328386,101241654,England,10.1080/15563650.2021.1948559 [doi],Snakes and acute kidney injury and hemolysis and schistocytes and thrombotic microangiopathies,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20210730,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

STUDY DESIGN: Four independent prospective observational cohort studies. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: The development cohort comprised 4,915 CKD patients, and 3 independent validation cohorts comprised a total of 3,063. Patients were observed for approximately 5 years. EXPOSURE: 22 demographic, anthropometric, and laboratory variables commonly assessed in CKD patients. OUTCOME: Progression to KFRT. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox proportional hazards model was fit to select laboratory variables that best identified patients at high risk for KFRT. Model discrimination and calibration were assessed and compared against the 4-variable Tangri (T4) risk equation both in a resampling approach within the development cohort and in the validation cohorts using cause-specific concordance (C) statistics, net reclassification improvement, and calibration graphs. RESULTS: The newly derived 6-variable risk score (Z6) included serum creatinine, albumin, cystatin C, and urea, as well as hemoglobin and the urinary albumin-creatinine ratio. In the the resampling approach, Z6 achieved a median C statistic of 0.909 (95% CI, 0.868-0.937) at 2 years after the baseline visit, whereas the T4 achieved a median C statistic of 0.855 (95% CI, 0.799-0.915). In the 3 independent validation cohorts, the Z6C statistics were 0.894, 0.921, and 0.891, whereas the T4C statistics were 0.882, 0.913, and 0.862. LIMITATIONS: The Z6 was both derived and tested only in White European cohorts.

There is no preference-based scoring system for the ESAS-r: Renal or a mapping algorithm to predict health utility values. We aimed to develop a mapping algorithm from the ESAS-r: Renal to the Canadian EQ-5D-5L index scores. METHODS: We used data from a multi-centre cluster randomized-controlled trial of the routine measurement and reporting of PROMs in hemodialysis units in Northern Alberta, Canada. In two arms of the trial, both the ESAS-r: Renal and the EQ-5D-5L were administered to CKD patients undergoing hemodialysis. We used data from one arm for model estimation, and data from the other for validation. We explored direct and indirect mapping models; model selection was based on statistical fit and predictive power. RESULTS: Complete data were available for 506 patient records in the estimation sample and 242 in the validation sample. All models tended to perform better in patients with good health, and worse in those with poor health. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) and generalized linear model (GLM) on selected ESAS-r: Renal items were selected as final models as they fitted the best in estimation and validation sample. CONCLUSION: When only ESAS-r: Renal data are available, one could use GEE and GLM to predict EQ-5D-5L index scores for use in economic evaluation. External validation on populations with different characteristics is warranted, especially where renal-specific symptoms are more prevalent.",2021/07/20 06:00,10.1007/s11136-021-02948-5 [pii] and 10.1007/s11136-021-02948-5 [doi],34278540,9210257,Netherlands,10.1007/s11136-021-02948-5 [doi],Chronic kidney disease and EQ-5D-5L and ESAS-r: Renal and Hemodialysis and Mapping and Utility,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,20220217,"Alberta and Humans and *Quality of Life/psychology and *Renal Insufficiency, Chronic and Surveys and Questionnaires and Symptom Assessment",NA,NA,NA,20210719,"Â© 2021.

METHODS: There were 308 hospital-acquired AKI and 721 non-AKI (NAKI) COVID-19 patients from Stony Brook Hospital (New York, USA) data, and 72 hospital-acquired AKI and 303 NAKI COVID-19 patients from Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China). Demographic, comorbidities, and longitudinal (3Â days before and 3Â days after AKI onset) clinical variables were used to compute odds ratios for and longitudinally predict hospital-acquired AKI onset. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients with AKI were more likely to die than NAKI patients (31.5% vs 6.9%, adjusted pâ€‰<â€‰0.001, ORâ€‰=â€‰4.67 [95% CI 3.1, 7.0], Stony Brook data). AKI developed on average 3.3Â days after hospitalization. Procalcitonin was elevated prior to AKI onset (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05), peaked, and remained elevated (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase peaked the same time as creatinine, whereas D-dimer and brain natriuretic peptide peaked a day later. C-reactive protein, white blood cell and lymphocyte showed group differences - 2Â days prior (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Top predictors were creatinine, procalcitonin, white blood cells, lactate dehydrogenase, and lymphocytes. They predicted AKI onset with areas under curves (AUCs) of 0.78, 0.66, and 0.56 at 0, - 1, and - 2Â days prior, respectively. When tested on the Tongji Hospital data, the AUCs were 0.80, 0.79, and 0.77, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Time-locked longitudinal data provide insight into AKI progression.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, observational cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 524 individuals enrolled into the Boston Kidney Biopsy Cohort (BKBC) Study undergoing clinically indicated native kidney biopsy with biopsy specimens adjudicated for semiquantitative scores of histopathology by 2 kidney pathologists and 3,800 individuals with common forms of chronic kidney disease (CKD) enrolled into the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study. EXPOSURE: Histopathologic lesions and clinicopathologic diagnosis in cross-sectional analyses, baseline plasma KIM-1 levels in prospective analyses. OUTCOMES: Baseline plasma KIM-1 levels in cross-sectional analyses, kidney failure (defined as initiation of kidney replacement therapy) and death in prospective analyses. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Multivariable-adjusted linear regression models tested associations of plasma KIM-1 levels with histopathologic lesions and clinicopathologic diagnoses. Cox proportional hazards models tested associations of plasma KIM-1 levels with future kidney failure and death. RESULTS: In the BKBC Study, higher plasma KIM-1 levels were associated with more severe acute tubular injury, tubulointerstitial inflammation, and more severe mesangial expansion after multivariable adjustment. Participants with diabetic nephropathy, glomerulopathies, and tubulointerstitial disease hadÂ significantly higher plasma KIM-1 levels after multivariable adjustment. In the BKBC Study, CKD in 124 participants progressed to kidney failure and 85 participants died during a median follow-up time of 5 years. In the CRIC Study, CKD in 1,153 participants progressed to kidney failure and 1,356 participants died during a median follow-up time of 11.5 years. In both cohorts, each doubling of plasma KIM-1 level was associated with an increased risk of kidney failure after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratios of 1.19 [95% CI, 1.03-1.38] and 1.10 [95% CI, 1.06-1.15] for BKBC and CRIC, respectively). There was no statistically significant association of plasma KIM-1 levels with death in either cohort. LIMITATIONS: Generalizability and unmeasured confounding.

We aimed to compare quality of AMI care in England and Wales during and before the COVID-19 pandemic using the 2020 European Society of Cardiology Association for Acute Cardiovascular Care quality indicators (QIs) for AMI. METHODS: Cohort study of linked data from the AMI and the percutaneous coronary intervention registries in England and Wales between 1 January 2017 and 27 May 2020 (representing 236 743 patients from 186 hospitals). At the patient level, the likelihood of attainment for each QI compared with pre COVID-19 was calculated using logistic regression. The date of the first national lockdown in England and Wales (23 March 2020) was chosen for time series comparisons. RESULTS: There were 10 749 admissions with AMI after 23 March 2020. Compared with before the lockdown, patients admitted with AMI during the first wave had similar age (mean 68.0 vs 69.0 years), with no major differences in baseline characteristics (history of diabetes (25% vs 26%), renal failure (6.4% vs 6.9%), heart failure (5.8% vs 6.4%) and previous myocardial infarction (22.9% vs 23.7%)), and less frequently had high Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk scores (43.6% vs 48.6%). There was an improvement in attainment for 10 (62.5%) of the 16 measured QIs including a composite QI (43.8% to 45.2%, OR 1.06, 95%â€‰CI 1.02 to 1.10) during, compared with before, the lockdown. CONCLUSION: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in England and Wales, quality of care for AMI as measured against international standards did not worsen, but improved modestly.",2022/01/27 06:00,bmjqs-2021-013040 [pii] and 10.1136/bmjqs-2021-013040 [doi],34158396,101546984,NA,10.1136/bmjqs-2021-013040 [doi] and bmjqs-2021-013040,*COVID-19 and *performance measures and *quality improvement,NOTNLM,NA,NLM,20220124,Aged and *COVID-19 and Cohort Studies and Communicable Disease Control and England/epidemiology and Humans and *Myocardial Infarction/epidemiology/therapy and Pandemics and SARS-CoV-2 and Wales/epidemiology,PMC8228654,NA,Competing interests: None declared.,20210622,Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

Because a therapeutic regimen remains scarce, the early implementation of preventive strategies is crucial. The authors investigated risk factors and the typical clinical course of CS-associated AKI (CS-AKI) to derive strategies for perioperative clinical routines. DESIGN: Retrospective data analysis. SETTING: The data were collected from clinical routines in a maximum care university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients. INTERVENTIONS: The authors retrospectively analyzed data from 538 patients who underwent CS. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The median age of the 466 patients included was 66.6 years; 65.7% were men. AKI occurred in 131 (28.1%) patients, mainly (89.0%) starting postoperatively within 72 hours p. Thirty-one (6.7%) patients showed Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome AKI stage 3. AKI was significantly more frequent in patients with chronic kidney disease (p < 0.001), emergency admission (p < 0.001), heart failure (p < 0.001), and postoperative complications (p < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, postoperative CS-AKI risk significantly decreased with each 1 or 10 mL/min preoperative glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (odds ratio, 0.962 and 0.677; 95% confidence interval, 0.947-0.977 and 0.577-0.793; p < 0.001 and p < 0.0001). Only in patients who developed Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome AKI stage 3, an early postoperative trend to decreased GFR and increased creatinine levels was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Especially in patients with preexisting CKD and signs of CS-AKI occurring on the day of surgery, close monitoring of renal function should be performed for at least 72 hours after CS to detect an onset of AKI early and initiate renal protective strategies. Optimal preoperative fluid management might prevent postoperative AKI.",2022/02/01 06:00,S1053-0770(21)00425-0 [pii] and 10.1053/j.jvca.2021.05.012 [doi],34130896,9110208,United States,S1053-0770(21)00425-0 [pii] and 10.1053/j.jvca.2021.05.012 [doi],*acute kidney injury and *cardiac surgery and *cardiac surgeryâ€“related acute kidney injury and *early detection and *postoperative renal failure,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,20220131,*Acute Kidney Injury/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology and Aged and *Cardiac Surgical Procedures/adverse effects and Glomerular Filtration Rate and Humans and Male and Postoperative Complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology and Retrospective Studies and Risk Factors,NA,NA,NA,20210514,Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Lung ultrasound is useful for assessing the presence and severity of pulmonary congestion, but the most widely validated 28-zone study is cumbersome. We sought to compare abbreviated 4-, 6-, and 8-zone studies to 28-zone studies. STUDY DESIGN: Diagnostic test study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of 98 patients with kidney failure on hemodialysis presenting to an emergency department in the United States. TESTS COMPARED: 4-, 6-, and 8-zone lung ultrasound studies versus a 28-zone lung ultrasound. OUTCOME: Prediction of pulmonary congestion and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: All patients completed a 28-zone lung ultrasound. Correlation coefficients (nonparametric Spearman) between each of the studies were high (all values > 0.84). Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement. Each of the short-form studies discriminated well with area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve > 0.83 for no-to-mild versus moderate-to-severe pulmonary congestion. During a median follow-up period of 778 days, 46 (47%) died. Patients with moderate-to-severe pulmonary congestion on lung ultrasound had a 30-day mortality rate similar to that observed among patients with no-to-mild pulmonary congestion (OR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.70-1.29]). LIMITATIONS: Single-center study conducted in an emergency care setting, convenience sample of patients, and lack of long-term follow-up data. CONCLUSIONS: Among hemodialysis patients presenting to an emergency department, 4-, 6-, or 8-zone lung ultrasounds were comparable to 28-zone studies for the assessment of pulmonary congestion.

This analysis of CREDENCE trial data examines the effect of canagliflozin on the incidence of kidney-related adverse events (AEs). STUDY DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter international trial. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 4,401 trial participants with T2DM, CKD, and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio >300-5,000 mg/g. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive canagliflozin 100 mg/d or placebo. OUTCOMES: Rates of kidney-related AEs were analyzed using an on-treatment approach, overall and by screening estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) strata (30-<45, 45-<60, and 60-<90 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). RESULTS: Canagliflozin was associated with a reduction in the overall incidence rate of kidney-related AEs (60.2 vs 84.0 per 1,000 patient-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.71 [95% CI, 0.61-0.82]; PÂ < 0.001), with consistent results for serious kidney-related AEs (HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.51-1.00]; P = 0.05) and acute kidney injury (AKI; HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.64-1.13]; P = 0.3). The rates of kidney-related AEs were lower with canagliflozin relative to placebo across the 3Â eGFR strata (HRs of 0.73, 0.60, and 0.81 for eGFR 30-<45, 45-<60, and 60-<90 mL/min/1.73 m(2), respectively; P = 0.3 for interaction), with similar results for AKI (P = 0.9 for interaction). Full recovery of kidney function within 30 days after an AKI event occurred more frequently with canagliflozin versus placebo (53.1% vs 35.4%; odds ratio, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.0-4.7]; PÂ =Â 0.04). LIMITATIONS: Kidney-related AEs including AKI were investigator-reported and collected without central adjudication. Biomarkers of AKI and structural tubular damage were not measured, and creatinine data after an AKI event were not available for all participants. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, canagliflozin was associated with a reduced incidence of serious and nonserious kidney-related AEs in patients with T2DM and CKD. These results highlight the safety of canagliflozin with regard to adverse kidney-related AEs.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the epidemiological features, risk factors, and adverse outcomes of AKI in this population. METHODS: The data used in this multi-center, hospitalized population-based, retrospective study were retrieved from electronic medical records. AKI was defined as an acute increase in serum creatinine according to the criteria of Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes. The Charlson Comorbidity Index was used to evaluate the burden of in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of 3,371 adult patients in 11 hospitals, 398 (11.8%) were diagnosed with AKI (grade 1, 218 [6.5%]; grade 2, 89 [2.6%]; grade 3, 91 [2.7%]). Herbicide intoxication was associated with the highest incidence of AKI (53.5%) and higher grades of AKI. After multivariable adjustment, pesticide categories and moderate or severe renal disease were independently associated with AKI. As compared with the referred category, insecticide and herbicide intoxications were associated with a 1.3-fold (95% CIâ€‰1.688-3.245) and 3.8-fold (95% CIâ€‰3.537-6.586) greater risk of AKI. Regardless of the pesticide category, AKI was independently associated with in-hospital mortality, with odds ratios of 3.433 (95% CIâ€‰1.436-8.203) for insecticides, 2.153 (95% CIâ€‰1.377-3.367) for herbicides, and 4.524 (95% CIâ€‰1.230-16.632) for unclassified or other pesticides. CONCLUSION: AKI is common in pesticide intoxication and associated with an increased in-hospital mortality. Herbicides pose the greatest risks of AKI and death.",2021/05/19 06:00,10.1007/s11255-021-02885-9 [pii] and 2885 [pii] and 10.1007/s11255-021-02885-9 [doi],34003429,0262521,NA,10.1007/s11255-021-02885-9 [doi],Acute kidney injury and Adverse outcome and Epidemiology and Pesticide and Risk factor,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,PMC8782793,NA,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,20210518,Â© 2021.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of preemptive kidney transplantation (PKT) and of pretransplant dialysis duration on graft survival among French pediatric kidney transplant recipients. METHODS: We analyzed all first pediatric kidney-only transplantations performed in France between 1993 and 2012. A Cox multivariable model was used to investigate the association of PKT and pretransplant dialysis time with the hazard of graft failure defined as death, return to dialysis, or retransplant, whichever occurred first. RESULTS: Patients (n = 1911) were included, of which 380 (19.8%) received a PKT. Median time of follow-up was 7.0 y. PKT was associated with a 55% reduction of the hazard of graft failure at any time after KT compared with patients transplanted after dialysis (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.62), after adjustment for recipient sex and age, primary kidney disease, donor age and type (living or deceased donor), number of HLA mismatches, cold ischemia time, and year of transplantation. A reduction of the hazard of graft failure was found in PKT whatever the compared duration of dialysis, even when <6 mo and whatever the dialysis modality. Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In France, PKT among pediatric patients is associated with a better graft survival when compared with KT after dialysis, even when <6 mo.

However, its prognostic value in stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD5) patients and the effects of parathyroidectomy (PTX) on nondipping HR remain unknown. METHODS: This case-control study of 162 healthy controls and 502 CKD5 patients was performed between 2011 and 2018, in which CKD5 patients were further divided into non-PTX (nÂ = 186) and severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) with PTX (nÂ = 316) subgroups. Each participant underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring for HR ratio. Mortality was followed up in CKD5 patients (median time: 46.0 months). RESULTS: The HR ratio in CKD5 patients was higher than in controls (0.92 Â± 0.08 vs 0.81 Â± 0.08, P <.001), associated with a 44% increase in mortality risk per 0.1 increment (hazard ratio, 1.44; 95% CI: 1.02-2.03; PÂ =.04), and was positively related to serum intact parathyroid hormone levels (P <.001). PTX reversed nondipping HR in SHPT patients (nÂ = 50, median time: 6.3 months, P <.001). Survival probabilities for PTX (nÂ = 294) were better than non-PTX (nÂ = 47) (hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% CI: 0.14-0.67; P <.01) in SHPT patients (serum intact parathyroid hormone >500.0 pg/mL). CONCLUSION: CKD5 patients displayed a nondipping HR pattern, which is a prognostic marker of all-cause mortality. PTX for SHPT patients was associated with a reversal in nondipping HR ratio, which may mediate a better outcome.",2022/02/01 06:00,S1530-891X(21)00050-1 [pii] and 10.1016/j.eprac.2021.02.007 [doi],33610808,9607439,United States,S1530-891X(21)00050-1 [pii] and 10.1016/j.eprac.2021.02.007 [doi],all-cause mortality and chronic kidney disease and circadian rhythm and intact parathyroid hormone and nondipping heart rate and parathyroidectomy,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,20220131,"Case-Control Studies and Heart Rate and Humans and *Hyperparathyroidism, Secondary/surgery and *Kidney Failure, Chronic and Parathyroid Hormone and Parathyroidectomy and *Renal Insufficiency, Chronic",NA,0 (Parathyroid Hormone),NA,20210219,Copyright Â© 2021 AACE.

Epub 2020 Sep and 16.,35,1531-1937 (Electronic) and 0897-1900 (Linking) and 1,75-79,"BACKGROUND: Systemic colistin is often utilized for management of drug resistant lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). Nebulized administration of colistin allows direct instillation of active agent to maximize concentrations and limit systemic toxicities. Current literature supports efficacy of nebulized colistin as adjunctive treatment for LRTI. However, there is a paucity of data surrounding safety of this administration technique. METHODS: The electronic medical record (EMR) was queried to identify patients treated with nebulized colistin between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2018. The data collected from the EMR and hospital adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting systems included: demographics, dose, serum creatinine (SCr), concomitant nephrotoxins, infecting pathogen, treatment-emergent ADRs, and drug toxicities. The primary outcome was prevalence of renal, neurologic, or respiratory ADRs secondary to nebulized colistin. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were administered nebulized colistin during the study period. Approximately 19% of patients had baseline chronic kidney disease. Cultures were positive in 29 patients of which 11 organisms were resistant to all tested antimicrobials. Three patients experienced acute kidney injury (AKI), 1 patient experienced a neurologic reaction, and 1 patient experienced a respiratory reaction, though none were considered treatment-related. CONCLUSION: The results of our study signify localized administration of colistin results in a low incidence of systemic adverse events.

METHODS: From January 6, 1968, to June 2019, 123 patients (112 adult and 11 pediatric patients) underwent heart retransplantation, and 2092 received primary transplantation at our institution. Propensity-score matching was used to account for baseline differences between the retransplantation and the primary transplantation-only groups. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed. The primary end point was all-cause mortality, and secondary end points were postoperative complications. RESULTS: Retransplantation recipient age was 39.6Â Â±Â 16.4Â years, and donor age was 26.4Â Â±Â 11.2Â years. Ninety-two recipients (74.8%) were male. Compared with recipients who only underwent primary heart transplantation, retransplantation recipients were more likely to have hypertension (44/73.3% vs 774/53.3%, PÂ =Â .0022), hyperlipidemia (40/66.7% vs 447/30.7%, PÂ <Â .0001), and require dialysis (7/11.7% vs 42/2.9%, PÂ =Â .0025). The indications for heart retransplantation were cardiac allograft vasculopathy (32/80%), primary graft dysfunction (6/15%), and refractory acute rejection (2/5%). After matching, postoperative outcomes such as hospital length of stay, severe primary graft dysfunction requiring intra-aortic balloon pump or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, cerebral vascular accident, respiratory failure, renal failure requiring dialysis, and infection were similar between the 2 groups. Matched median survival after retransplantation was 4.6Â years compared with 6.5Â years after primary heart transplantation (log-rank PÂ =Â .36, stratified log-rank PÂ =Â .0063). CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center cohort, the unadjusted long-term survival after heart retransplantation was inferior to that after primary heart transplantation, and short-term survival difference persisted after propensity-score matching.

We assessed the influence of chronic kidney disease on 10-year mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with ischemic heart failure treated with medical therapy (medical treatment) with or without coronary artery bypass grafting. METHODS: We calculated the baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula, chronic kidney disease stages 1-5) from 1209 patients randomized to medical treatment or coronary artery bypass grafting in the Surgical Treatment for IsChemic Heart failure trial and assessed its effect on outcome. RESULTS: In the overall Surgical Treatment for IsChemic Heart failure cohort, patients with chronic kidney disease stages 3 to 5 were older than those with stages 1 and 2 (66-71Â years vs 54-59Â years) and had more comorbidities. Multivariable modeling revealed an inverse association between estimated glomerular filtration rate and risk of death, cardiovascular death, or cardiovascular rehospitalization (all PÂ <Â .001, but not for stroke, PÂ =Â .697). Baseline characteristics of the 2 treatment arms were equal for each chronic kidney disease stage. There were significant improvements in death or cardiovascular rehospitalization with coronary artery bypass grafting (stage 1: hazard ratio, 0.71; confidence interval, 0.53-0.96, PÂ =Â .02; stage 2: hazard ratio, 0.71; confidence interval, 0.59-0.84, PÂ <Â .0001; stage 3: hazard ratio, 0.76; confidence interval, 0.53-0.96, PÂ =Â .03). These data were inconclusive in stages 4 and 5 for insufficient patient numbers (NÂ =Â 28). There was no significant interaction of estimated glomerular filtration rate with the treatment effect of coronary artery bypass grafting (PÂ =Â .25 for death and PÂ =Â .54 for death or cardiovascular rehospitalization). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic kidney disease is an independent risk factor for mortality in patients with ischemic heart failure with or without coronary artery bypass grafting.

This study aimed to describe the role of inflammatory markers in the relationship between APOL1 and incident kidney outcomes using a prospective cohort study. METHODS: APOL1 high-risk status under a recessive genetic model was studied in 10,605 AA adults aged â‰¥45 years from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study. The primary variables of interest were inflammatory markers: C-reactive protein (mg/dL), white blood cell count (cells/mm3), and serum albumin (sALB) (mg/dL). High inflammation status was defined if at least one of these inflammatory markers exceeded clinical threshold. The association between APOL1 and biomarkers were assessed using regression models adjusting for age, sex, ancestry, hypertension, lipid medications, albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Models were stratified by diabetes status. We identified incident ESKD using USRDS linkage, and we defined incident CKD as an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and â‰¥25% decline in the eGFR and normal baseline eGFR and tested for mediation of APOL1 and outcomes by biomarkers using the causal inference approach. RESULTS: Among 7,151 participants with data available on all inflammation markers, 4,479 participants had â‰¥1 marker meeting the clinical threshold. APOL1 high-risk status was associated with lower adjusted odds of reduced sALB {odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval [CI]): 0.59 [0.36, 0.96])}, and this association was significant in people with diabetes (OR [95% CI]: 0.40 [0.18, 0.89]) but not in those without diabetes. There was no association of APOL1 high-risk status with other markers or high inflammation status. APOL1 was independently associated with ESKD (OR [95% CI] = 1.78 [1.28, 2.48]) and CKD (OR [95% CI] = 1.38 [1.00, 1.91]). On mediation analysis, the direct effect between APOL1 and ESKD strengthened after accounting for sALB, but the estimated mediated effect was not statistically significant (OR [95% CI]: 0.98 [0.92, 1.05], p = 0.58). CONCLUSION: APOL1 high-risk variants were associated with sALB. However, sALB did not statistically mediate the association between APOL1 and incident ESKD.",2022/02/01 06:00,000520997 [pii] and 10.1159/000520997 [doi],35100591,8109361,Switzerland,10.1159/000520997 [doi],APOL1 and End-stage kidney disease and Inflammation and Mediation and Serum albumin,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20220131,"Â© 2022 S.

Therefore, we investigated the potential relationship between skin AGEs accumulation and frailty. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was performed on 2521 participants from Rotterdam study. Skin AGEs were assessed as skin autofluorescence (SAF) using the AGE readerTM. We used two approaches to define frailty. Fried's criteria, including weight loss, weakness, slow gait speed, exhaustion and low physical activity, were used to define physical frailty (presence of â‰¥3 components) and pre-frailty (presence of â‰¤2 components). Rockwood's concept including 38 deficits from physical and psychosocial health domains, was used to calculate frailty index (score 0-1). Multinomial logistic and multivariate linear regression were used with SAF as exposure and physical frailty (ordinal) and frailty index (continuous) as outcome adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, renal function, socioeconomic and smoking status. RESULTS: Mean SAF was 2.39 Â± 0.49 AU and median age 74.2 (14.0) years. Regarding physical frailty, 96 persons (4%) were frail and 1221 (48%) pre-frail. SAF was associated with both being pre-frail [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 1.29 (1.07 - 1.56)] and frail [1.87 (1.20 - 2.90)] compared with non-frail. Regarding frailty index, the median value was 0.14 (0.10-0.19) and higher SAF was also associated with a higher frailty index [coefficient, B=0.017(0.011-0.023)]. CONCLUSION: Higher skin AGEs are associated with both physical frailty and frailty index.

Limited data exist on the prevalence of sepsis using current definitions in ICUs in India. RESEARCH QUESTION: In adult patients admitted to ICUs in India, what is the prevalence of sepsis using the previous (Second International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock [Sepsis-2]) and current (Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock [Sepsis-3]) definitions? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Prospective, observational, multicentre, 1-day, cross-sectional study. The primary outcome was the sepsis prevalence using both the Sepsis-2 and Sepsis-3 definitions and their concordance (using Cohen's Îº coefficient). Additional outcomes included reporting on current microbiological characteristics, antimicrobial use, multidrug-resistant infections, and 30-day discharge and mortality status in patients with sepsis. RESULTS: A total of 35 ICUs (85.7%Â private, 14.3%Â public) participated, enrolling 680 patients (median age, 60 years [interquartile range, 24 years]; 62.1%Â men). The most common primary diagnosis was renal disease, and common comorbidities were diabetes (44.0%) and chronic renal failure (11.6%). The sepsis prevalence on the study day was 382 of 677 patients (56.4%). Prevalence by Sepsis-3 and Sepsis-2 definitions was 33.2%Â and 46.2%, respectively, with minimal concordance (ÎºÂ = 0.32). In patients with sepsis, the most common microorganisms were bacterial (77.9%) followed by fungal (14.1%) infections. Approximately 45%Â of infections were caused by multidrug-resistant organisms. Mortality at 30Â day after the study day (27.6%Â vsÂ 5.3%; PÂ < .01) and rates of discharge against medical advice (12.8%Â vsÂ 4.9%; PÂ < .01) were significantly higher in the sepsis cohort compared with the cohort without sepsis, respectively.

develop prediction models for COVID-19 to increase the speed at which prediction models can reliably be developed and validated early in a pandemic. We developed COVID-19 Estimated Risk (COVER) scores that quantify a patient's risk of hospital admission with pneumonia (COVER-H), hospitalization with pneumonia requiring intensive services or death (COVER-I), or fatality (COVER-F) in the 30-days following COVID-19 diagnosis using historical data from patients with influenza or flu-like symptoms and tested this in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We analyzed a federated network of electronic medical records and administrative claims data from 14 data sources and 6 countries containing data collected on or before 4/27/2020. We used a 2-step process to develop 3 scores using historical data from patients with influenza or flu-like symptoms any time prior to 2020. The first step was to create a data-driven model using LASSO regularized logistic regression, the covariates of which were used to develop aggregate covariates for the second step where the COVER scores were developed using a smaller set of features. These 3 COVER scores were then externally validated on patients with 1) influenza or flu-like symptoms and 2) confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis across 5 databases from South Korea, Spain, and the United States. Outcomes included i) hospitalization with pneumonia, ii) hospitalization with pneumonia requiring intensive services or death, and iii) death in the 30â€‰days after index date. RESULTS: Overall, 44,507 COVID-19 patients were included for model validation. We identified 7 predictors (history of cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, kidney disease) which combined with age and sex discriminated which patients would experience any of our three outcomes. The models achieved good performance in influenza and COVID-19 cohorts. For COVID-19 the AUC ranges were, COVER-H: 0.69-0.81, COVER-I: 0.73-0.91, and COVER-F: 0.72-0.90. Calibration varied across the validations with some of the COVID-19 validations being less well calibrated than the influenza validations. CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrated the utility of using a proxy disease to develop a prediction model. The 3 COVER models with 9-predictors that were developed using influenza data perform well for COVID-19 patients for predicting hospitalization, intensive services, and fatality. The scores showed good discriminatory performance which transferred well to the COVID-19 population. There was some miscalibration in the COVID-19 validations, which is potentially due to the difference in symptom severity between the two diseases. A possible solution for this is to recalibrate the models in each location before use.",2022/02/03 06:00,10.1186/s12874-022-01505-z [pii] and 1505 [pii] and 10.1186/s12874-022-01505-z [doi],35094685,100968545,NA,10.1186/s12874-022-01505-z [doi] and 35,*COVID-19 and *Patient-level prediction modelling and *Risk score,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,20220202,"*COVID-19 and COVID-19 Testing and Humans and *Influenza, Human/epidemiology and *Pneumonia and SARS-CoV-2 and United States",PMC8801189,NA,"RDW, AM, CY, TDS, TF, JJ, CK, YR, AW, AA, MHO, MA, CA, EB, YHC, ID, MTFA, SFB, JAK, and STL, FN, RWP, NP, TS, MS, EWS, SCY, LZ(Zhang), LZ(Zhou), report no conflicts of and interest.

METHODS: An electronic search of the PubMed, Embase, Central, and Web of Science databases for studies comparing sex differences in outcomes among patients undergoing TEER was performed. Summary estimates were primarily conducted using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Eleven studies with a total of 24,905 patients (45.6% women) were included. Women were older and had a lower prevalence of comorbidities, including diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and coronary artery disease. There was no difference in procedural success (odds ratio [OR]: 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.55-1.05) and short-term mortality (i.e., up to 30 days) between women and men (OR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.97-1.39). Women had a higher incidence of periprocedural bleeding and stroke (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.15-1.56) and (OR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.10-2.25), respectively. At a median follow-up of 12 months, there was no difference in mortality (OR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.89-1.09) and heart failure hospitalizations (OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.68-1.67). An analysis of adjusted long-term mortality showed a lower incidence of mortality among women (hazards ratio: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67-0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a lower prevalence of baseline comorbidities, women undergoing TEER with MitraClip had higher unadjusted rates of periprocedural stroke and bleeding as compared with men. There was no difference in unadjusted procedural success, short-term or long-term mortality. However, women had lower adjusted mortality on long-term follow-up.

SIRT1 gene is very polymorph with a few tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) so far identified. Some SNPs, including rs7896005, were associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). We aimed to ascertain whether this SNP may be associated with CV disease at baseline as well with these same outcomes and all-cause mortality over a 13-year follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genotypes of SIRT1 gene were determined using TaqMan SNP assay. RESULTS: Out of 905 T2DM, 9.1% had the AA genotype, 43.2% the AG, and 47.7% the GG. Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium was met (minor allele frequency 0.306; pÂ =Â 0.8899). At baseline, there was no difference across genotypes for sex, age, diabetes duration, CV risk factors, treatments, and microangiopathy. Major CV outcomes, myocardial infarction (MI), any coronary heart disease (CHD), and peripheral artery disease (PAD) were more frequent in GG than in AA/AG (p from 0.013 to 0.027), with no association with cerebrovascular events. By fully adjusted regression, GG remained independently related to major CV outcomes, MI, CHD, and PAD. Over follow-up, we recorded 258 major CV events (28.5%; AA/AG 25.2%, GG 32.2%; pÂ =Â 0.014) with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of GG versus AA/AG of 1.296 (95% CI 1.007-1.668, pÂ =Â 0.044); 169 coronary events (18.7%; AA/AG 15.4%, GG 22.2%; pÂ =Â 0.006) with HR 1.522 (1.113-2.080, pÂ =Â 0.008); 79 (8.7%) hospitalisation for heart failure (AA/AG 7.0%, GG 10.6%; pÂ =Â 0.045) and HR 1.457 (0.919-2.309, pÂ =Â 0.109); 36 PAD (4.0%; AA/AG 2.3%, GG 5.8%; pÂ =Â 0.007) with HR 2.225 (1.057-4.684, pÂ =Â 0.035). No association was found with cerebrovascular events, end stage renal disease, and all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The rs7896005 SNP of SIRT1 might play a role in cardiovascular disease, mainly CHD risk in T2DM.

It can be a serious problem, especially in developing countries including Morocco. However, few studies have explored the factors influencing chronic kidney disease in this country. Hence, using the definitions proposed by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes in 2012, we have conducted this study to establish the prevalence and risk factors of chronic kidney disease particularly in rural communities in the Fez-Meknes region. METHODS: Weight, height, blood pressure, proteinuria, hematuria, plasma creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula), and fasting glycemia were measured. Abnormal results were controlled within two weeks; estimated Glomerular filtration rate was retested at 3Â months. Furthermore, to determine the factors associated with chronic kidney disease, multivariate logistic regression was used. RESULTS: A total of 431Â patients participated in the study; the prevalence of confirmed proteinuria, hematuria, and reduced estimated Glomerular filtration rate was 5.3%, 1.8%, and 3%, respectively. Overall, chronic kidney disease was found to be present in 6.5% of the population. Chronic kidney diseaseÂ 1 and 2 accounted for 32.1% and 21.4% of the overall chronic kidney disease population, respectively, while chronic kidney diseaseÂ 3 accounted for 46.4% (3A: 38.2%; 3B: 7.14%). Chronic kidney diseaseÂ 4 and 5 were not present in the total chronic kidney disease population. Chronic kidney disease was strongly linked with advanced age (OR 2.65; 95%CI: 1.05-6.65), hypertension (OR 2.41; 95%CI: 1.03-5.63), agricultural occupation (OR 1.02; 95%CI: 1.00-1.04) and contact with Agrochemicals (OR 1.40; 95%CI: 0.81-2.71). CONCLUSIONS: It is important to note that screening for kidney damage and being aware of the risks linked to it, is key for the early detection and management of chronic kidney disease; they are also crucial to provide in a database for the development of a national prevention policy.",2022/02/02 06:00,S1769-7255(21)00572-1 [pii] and 10.1016/j.nephro.2021.11.005 [doi],35101356,101248950,France,S1769-7255(21)00572-1 [pii] and 10.1016/j.nephro.2021.11.005 [doi],Chronic kidney disease and Epidemiology and Estimated Glomerular filtration rate and Hematuria and Morocco and Proteinuria,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20220128,"Copyright Â© 2021 SociÃ©tÃ© francophone de nÃ©phrologie, dialyse et transplantation. and Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Patients with COVID-19 with AKI have high mortality rates. OBJECTIVE: Individuals with African ancestry with 2 copies of apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) variants G1 or G2 (high-risk group) have significantly increased rates of kidney disease. We tested the hypothesis that the APOL1 high-risk group is associated with a higher-risk of COVID-19-associated AKI and death. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study included 990 participants with African ancestry enrolled in the Million Veteran Program who were hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 2020 and January 2021 with available genetic information. EXPOSURES: The primary exposure was having 2 APOL1 risk variants (RV) (APOL1 high-risk group), compared with having 1 or 0 risk variants (APOL1 low-risk group). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was AKI. The secondary outcomes were stages of AKI severity and death. Multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusted for preexisting comorbidities, medications, and inpatient AKI risk factors; 10 principal components of ancestry were performed to study these associations. We performed a subgroup analysis in individuals with normal kidney function prior to hospitalization (estimated glomerular filtration rate â‰¥60 mL/min/1.73 m2). RESULTS: Of the 990 participants with African ancestry, 905 (91.4%) were male with a median (IQR) age of 68 (60-73) years. Overall, 392 (39.6%) patients developed AKI, 141 (14%) developed stages 2 or 3 AKI, 28 (3%) required dialysis, and 122 (12.3%) died. One hundred twenty-five (12.6%) of the participants were in the APOL1 high-risk group. Patients categorized as APOL1 high-risk group had significantly higher odds of AKI (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.95; 95% CI, 1.27-3.02; Pâ€‰=â€‰.002), higher AKI severity stages (OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.37-2.99; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001), and death (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.22-3.72; Pâ€‰=â€‰.007). The association with AKI persisted in the subgroup with normal kidney function (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.15-3.26; Pâ€‰=â€‰.01). Data analysis was conducted between February 2021 and April 2021.

In previous work, we investigated the genetic basis of this heterogeneity by clustering 94 T2D genetic loci using their associations with 47 diabetes-related traits and identified five clusters labeled: Î²-cell, proinsulin, obesity, lipodystrophy, and liver/lipid. The relationship between these clusters and individual-level metabolic disease outcomes has not been assessed. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Here we constructed individual-level partitioned polygenic scores (pPS) for these five clusters in 12 studies from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium and the UK Biobank (n = 454,193) and tested for cross-sectional association with T2D-related outcomes, including blood pressure, renal function, insulin use, age at T2D diagnosis, and coronary artery disease (CAD). RESULTS: Despite all clusters containing T2D risk-increasing alleles, they had differential associations with metabolic outcomes. Increased obesity and lipodystrophy cluster pPS, which had opposite directions of association with measures of adiposity, were both significantly associated with increased blood pressure and hypertension. The lipodystrophy and liver/lipid cluster pPS were each associated with CAD, with increasing and decreasing effects, respectively. An increased liver/lipid cluster pPS was also significantly associated with reduced renal function. The liver/lipid cluster includes known loci linked to liver lipid metabolism (e.g., GCKR, PNPLA3, and TM6SF2), and these findings suggest that cardiovascular disease risk and renal function may be impacted by these loci through their shared disease pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support that genetically driven pathways leading to T2D also predispose differentially to clinical outcomes.",2022/01/28 06:00,141024 [pii] and 10.2337/dc21-1395 [doi],35085396,7805975,United States,dc211395 [pii] and 10.2337/dc21-1395 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20220127,Â© 2022 by the American Diabetes Association.,K99 DK127196/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States and U01 HG011723/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Steroid replacement therapy (SRT) is often required in patients with AI because of acute symptoms and complications. The long-term effects of SRT on kidney function have not been well elucidated. METHODS: Overall, 788 patients diagnosed with AI between 2010 and 2015 at Yonsei University Health System were retrospectively evaluated. SRT was defined when an equivalent dose of â‰¥5 mg/d of hydrocortisone was initiated within 30 days of AI diagnosis and maintained for >30 days. Those not included in the SRT group were identified as the no-SRT group. The primary outcome was 40% reduction in the estimated glomerular filtration rate compared with baseline sustained for â‰¥30 days or end-stage kidney disease development. RESULTS: The mean age of was 63.1 Â± 15.4 years, and 43.0% were men. The SRT group comprised 387 patients. During a median follow-up duration of 4.1 years, the primary outcome occurred in 118 (15.0%) patients. The outcome incidence rate was higher in the SRT group (4.61/100 patient-years) than in the no-SRT group (2.76/100 patient-years). When the subdistribution hazard ratio for kidney outcome was assessed with death as a competing risk, the risk was 67% higher in the SRT group than in the no-SRT group (subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-2.45; PÂ = .006). This association was maintained with inverse probability of treatment weighting and adjustment for confounding variables. CONCLUSION: Kidney function decline was more prominent in patients with AI who received SRT.

The Alliance for Quality Assessment in Healthcare-Dialysis (AQuAH-D) aims to conduct efficient and timely cohort studies on associations between those variations and clinical and patient-reported outcomes. PARTICIPANTS: Included are outpatients aged 20 years old or older who are undergoing haemodialysis and have consented to participate. A total of 2895 patients were enrolled from 25 facilities in Japan between August 2018 and July 2020 and are to be followed until 31 December 2026. Chart review and annual questionnaires are used to collect data on patient characteristics and on outcomes including quality of life. Data on medications, haemodialysis prescriptions and blood tests are obtained from existing electronic records. Data are collected retrospectively from 1 January 2017 to patient enrolment, and prospectively from patient enrolment until the end of December 2026. FINDINGS TO DATE: To date, the mean age is 68.3 (SD 12.2) years and 35.2% are female. The most common cause of kidney failure is diabetic nephropathy (37.4%). In January 2020, the facilities' median weekly doses of erythropoietin stimulating agent (ESA) and of intravenous vitamin D ranged from 1846 to 9692â€‰IU (epoetin alfa equivalent) and 0.78 to 2.25â€‰Âµg (calcitriol equivalent), respectively. The facilities' percentages of patients to whom calcimimetics are prescribed varied from 19% to 79%. During the retrospective period (averaging 1.85 years per participant), the incidence rates of any hospitalisation and of hospitalisation due to cardiovascular disease were 67.2 and 12.0 per 100 person-years, respectively.

Hypomagnesemia is not rare among non-dialysis CKD patients despite their decreased glomerular filtration rates; the prevalence rate was about 15% even in CKD stages G4 and G5. Among several potential causes of hypomagnesemia, tubular dysfunction/interstitial fibrosis may play a pivotal role in the development of hypomagnesemia in CKD, which impairs tubular magnesium reabsorption. Magnesium deficiency may, in turn, be involved in the progression of CKD. An in vitro study has revealed that magnesium deficiency aggravates tubular cell death and inflammation induced by phosphate load. In a cohort study of patients with CKD, low-serum magnesium levels enhanced the risk of end-stage kidney disease related to high-serum phosphate levels, suggesting a close relationship between magnesium deficiency and phosphate toxicity. More importantly, magnesium has a potent capacity to inhibit the calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells induced by phosphate. A randomized trial has shown the efficacy of oral magnesium oxide in retarding the progression of coronary artery calcification among non-dialysis CKD patients. Thus, magnesium might provide better cardiovascular prognosis; indeed, hemodialysis patients with mild hypermagnesemia exhibited the lowest mortality rate. Further randomized trials are needed to assess the impact of magnesium in terms of hard clinical outcomes among CKD patients.",2022/01/26 06:00,10.1007/s10157-022-02182-4 [pii] and 10.1007/s10157-022-02182-4 [doi],35076791,9709923,Japan,10.1007/s10157-022-02182-4 [doi],Chronic kidney disease and Fracture and Magnesium and Mortality and Phosphate and Vascular calcification,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20220125,Â© 2022.

Methods: From November 2019 to September 2020, a randomized controlled study was conducted on 136 BPH patients undergoing greenlight laser surgery in the Department of Urology, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University. The patient's age ranged from 53 to 85 years and the prostatic volume ranged from 30 to 104 ml. They were divided into two groups by random number table method,including 68 cases of AVIT(observation group)and 68 cases of PVP(control group). The clinical data of the two groups before, during and after operation were collected and analyzed. Results: Operations were successfully completed in the two groups. At 6 months after operation, 63 cases in the observation group and 66 cases in the control group completed the follow-up. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation and renal insufficiency between the two groups before operation (all P>0.05). The differences of preoperative age [(66.8Â±6.5) vs (67.3Â±5.4) years], international prostate symptom score (IPSS) [(24.2Â±4.7) vs (23.5Â±4.5) ], quality of life score (QOL) [4.7(4.1, 4.9) vs 4.6(4.2, 5.0)], peak urinary flow rate (Qmax) [(6.9Â±2.8) vs (6. 8Â±2.6) ml/s], post-void residual volume (PVR) [(137(52.8, 190.9) vs 119(70.6, 172.1) ml], prostate volume (PV) [70.5(60.6, 80.9) vs 68.2(61.2, 80.5) ml], serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) [4.4(3.5, 5.1) vs 4.4(3.4, 5.0) ng/ml] were not statistically significant between the two groups (all P>0.05). There was no significant difference in the amount of intraoperative blood loss, catheterization time and the postoperative hospitalization time between the two groups (all P>0.05). Compared with the control group, the operation time and lasing time of the observation group were longer[69.0(64.6, 75.0) vs 55.8(49.1, 63.4) min,(36.3Â±9.9) vs (31.3Â±9.3) min], and the intraoperaive laser energy consumption and laser energy density were higher[(297Â±20) vs (240Â±20) kJ,(4.50Â±1.35) vs (3.73Â±1.17) kJ/ml]. The differences were all statistically significant (all P<0.05). At the follow-up of 1, 3 and 6 months after operation, IPSS and QOL in the observation group were lower than those in the control group, and the differences were all statistically significant (all P<0.05). Qmax in the observation group was higher and PVR was lower than those in the control group, with statistically significant differences (P<0.05). Six months after operation, PV and PSA in the observation group decreased more significantly than those in the control group (56% vs 47%, 70% vs 60%, both P<0.05). No urethral stricture and urinary incontinence occurred in two groups after operation. The incidence rate of urinary tract irritation in the observation group was 6.3%(4/63),lower than the 18.2%(12/66)in the control group (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence rates of urinary retention, bladder neck contracture and secondary bleeding between the two groups (all P>0.05).

We evaluated whether traditional cardiovascular risk factors are associated with incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events among individuals with CAC=0 over long-term follow-up. METHODS: We included participants with CAC=0 at baseline from the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), a prospective cohort study of individuals free of clinical ASCVD at baseline. We used multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to study the association between cardiovascular risk factors (cigarette smoking, diabetes, hypertension, preventive medication use [aspirin and statin], family history of premature ASCVD, chronic kidney disease, waist circumference, lipid and inflammatory markers) and adjudicated incident ASCVD outcomes. RESULTS: We studied 3416 individuals (mean [SD] age 58 [9] years; 63% were female, 33% White, 31% Black, 12% Chinese American, and 24% Hispanic). Over a median follow-up of 16 years, there were 189 ASCVD events (composite of coronary heart disease and stroke) of which 91 were coronary heart disease, 88 were stroke, and 10 were both coronary heart disease and stroke events. The unadjusted event rates of ASCVD were â‰¤5 per 1000 person-years among individuals with CAC=0 for most risk factors with the exception of current cigarette smoking (7.3), diabetes (8.9), hypertension (5.4), and chronic kidney disease (6.8). After multivariable adjustment, risk factors that were significantly associated with ASCVD included current cigarette smoking: hazard ratio, 2.12 (95% CI, 1.32-3.42); diabetes: hazard ratio, 1.68 (95% CI, 1.01-2.80); and hypertension: hazard ratio, 1.57 (95% CI, 1.06-2.33). CONCLUSIONS: Current cigarette smoking, diabetes, and hypertension are independently associated with incident ASCVD over a 16-year follow-up among those with CAC=0.",2021/12/09 06:00,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.056705 [doi],34879218,0147763,NA,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.056705 [doi],*carotid artery diseases and *coronary artery disease and *heart disease risk factors,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,PMC8792296,NA,NA,20211208,NA,75N95020D00003/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States and HHSN268201500003C/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States and 75N90020D00002/CL/CLC NIH HHS/United States and N01HC95160/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States and 75N92022D00007/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States and N01HC95163/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States and 75N93020D00002/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States and N01HC95169/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States and N01HC95164/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States and N01HC95162/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States and 75N99020D00006/OF/ORFDO NIH HHS/United States and N01HC95165/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States and HHSN268201500003I/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States and 75N99020D00007/OF/ORFDO NIH HHS/United States and UL1 TR000040/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States and 75N98020D00007/OD/NIH HHS/United States and N01HC95166/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States and UL1 TR001881/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States and 75N95020D00004/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States and UL1 TR001079/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States and 75N96020D00002/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States and 75N99020D00003/OF/ORFDO NIH HHS/United States and 75N95020D00002/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States and N01HC95168/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States and 75N90020D00003/CL/CLC NIH HHS/United States and 75N96020D00003/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States and P30 DK063491/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States and 75N99020D00002/OF/ORFDO NIH HHS/United States and N01HC95159/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States and 75N95020D00007/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States and N01HC95161/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States and UL1 TR001420/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States and 75N95020D00005/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States and 75N92021D00006/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States and 75N99020D00005/OF/ORFDO NIH HHS/United States and N01HC95167/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States and 75N99020D00004/OF/ORFDO NIH HHS/United States and UL1 TR003098/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NIHMS1763791,2023/01/25,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the relationship between hyponatremia during late-stage CKD and the risk of poor outcomes after ESKD transition is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including 32â€‰257 US veterans transitioning to ESKD from 1 October 2007 to 30 March 2015. We evaluated adjusted associations between the 3-month averaged pre-transition to ESKD serum sodium and all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular (CV) mortality, infection-related mortalities and hospitalization rate. RESULTS: Cohort meanâ€‰Â±â€‰standard deviation serum sodium was 139â€‰Â±â€‰3 mEq/L, mean age was 67â€‰Â±â€‰11â€‰years, 98% were male and 28% were African American. Over a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 702â€‰days (296, 1301) there were 17â€‰162 deaths. Compared with the reference of 135 to <144 mEq/L, the lowest serum sodium group (<130 mEq/L) had a 54% higher all-cause mortality risk [hazard ratio 1.54 (95% confidence interval 1.34-1.76)] in the fully adjusted model. Associations were similar for CV and infection-related mortality, and hospitalization outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Hyponatremia prior to ESKD transition is associated with higher risk of all-cause, CV and infection-related mortalities, and hospitalization rates after ESKD transition. Future studies evaluating management of pre-ESKD hyponatremia may be indicated to improve patient outcomes for those transitioning to ESKD.",2021/08/15 06:00,6352506 [pii] and 10.1093/ndt/gfab203 [doi],34390572,8706402,England,10.1093/ndt/gfab203 [doi],ESKD transition and end-stage kidney disease and hospitalization and mortality and serum sodium,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Â© The Author(s) 2021.

STUDY DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Children with mild to moderate CKD enrolled in the CKiD study with available United States Census data. EXPOSURE: Neighborhood poverty and neighborhood disadvantage. OUTCOME(S): Binary outcomes of short stature, obesity, hypertension, healthcare utilization for cross-sectional analysis; progression to end stage kidney disease (ESKD), and mode of first kidney replacement therapy (KRT) for time-to-event analysis. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Cross-sectional analysis of health characteristics at time of first census data collection using logistic regression to estimate odds ratios. Risk for progression analyzed using a Cox proportional hazard model. Multivariable models adjusted for race, ethnicity, sex, and family income. RESULTS: There was strong agreement between family and neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics. Risk for short stature, hospitalization, and emergency department (ED) use were significantly associated with lower neighborhood income. After controlling for race, ethnicity, sex, and family income, odds of hospitalization (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.08, 2.71) and ED (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.02, 2.40) use remained higher for those with lower neighborhood income. The hazard ratio of reaching ESKD for participants living in lower income neighborhoods was significantly increased in the unadjusted model only (1.38, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.87). Likelihood of undergoing a preemptive transplant was decreased with lower neighborhood income (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.24, 0.96) and higher neighborhood deprivation (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.10, 0.97), but these associations did not persist after controlling for participant characteristics. LIMITATIONS: Limited generalizability, as only those with consistent longitudinal nephrology care were studied. CONCLUSIONS: Neighborhood-level SES was associated with poorer health characteristics and CKD progression in univariable analysis. However, the relationships were attenuated after accounting for participant-level factors including race. A persistent association of neighborhood poverty with hospitalizations and ED suggests an independent effect of SES on healthcare utilization the causes for which deserve additional study.",2022/01/28 06:00,S0272-6386(22)00032-4 [pii] and 10.1053/j.ajkd.2021.12.008 [doi],35085688,8110075,United States,S0272-6386(22)00032-4 [pii] and 10.1053/j.ajkd.2021.12.008 [doi],CKD and deprivation and hospitalization and income and neighborhood and poverty and progression,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20220124,Copyright Â© 2022.

Telepharmacy offer easier access to needed medications, preventing DRPs. Adoption has been slow, and it is unclear what aspects of telepharmacy are most important. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted health services, forcing the rapid adoption of telepharmacy. In Phayao, Thailand, a program was implemented for home delivery of drugs for patients with chronic disease. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the prevalence and factors associated with DRPs of patients with chronic disease who received home drug-delivery services. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was undertaken in Phayao Province located in North Thailand. Simple random sampling was used to select patients from 6 public hospitals between July and August 2020. Logistic regression was used to analyze multivariate factors that might be related to DRPs. RESULTS: A total of 246 participants reported at least 1 DRP (49.30%). Most participants were female (58.32%) with elementary education (60.72%). Their mean age was 63.69 (SDÂ = 12.97) years. The 5 most common DRPs were changes of drug packaging or drug brands (18.84%), leftover medications of more than 2 weeks (18.44%), nonadherence (17.43%), having conditions or diseases requiring additional medications (6.81%), and adverse drug reactions (5.21%). Univariate analysis identified number of chronic conditions, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, education level, and drug-delivery channel as predictors of DRPs. In multivariate analysis, predictors of DRPs were the number of drugs used per day (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.11 [95% CI 1.03-1.19], PÂ = 0.004) and dyslipidemia (aOR 1.83 [95% CI 1.18-2.84], PÂ = 0.007). Nonadherence was associated with leftover medicines (aOR 4.22 [95% CI 2.44-7.28], P < 0.001) CONCLUSION: The present results indicate that home delivery caused no increase and may have caused a decrease in DRPs, and patients were highly satisfied.

However, metabolic risk factors underlying NAFLD usually cause substantial differences in their clinical outcomes. Recently, several studies have used a novel definition of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) to reassess patients with NAFLD and pointed out the importance of metabolic risk factors. Since patients with NAFLD, MAFLD, or metabolic syndrome (MetS) have different burden of metabolic risk factors, it is crucial to decipher the risk of developing hepatic complications in these populations. METHODS: Through a longitudinal nationwide cohort study, the risk of liver cancer was investigated in patients with MetS alone, NAFLD alone, overlap NAFLD/MAFLD, and coexisting MetS and NAFLD. The general characteristics, comorbidities, and incidence of liver cancer were also compared. RESULTS: Intriguingly, patients diagnosed with MetS alone did not have a significant risk of developing HCC compared to control individuals, while patients with NAFLD alone, NAFLD/MAFLD, and coexisting NAFLD and MetS exhibited 6.08-, 5.81-, and 15.33-fold risks of developing HCC, respectively. Apart from metabolic risk factors, renal function status and liver cirrhosis were the independent risk factors for the development of HCC among these groups. CONCLUSION: Our data emphasize that metabolic dysfunction has a significant impact on hepatocarcinogenesis in patients with NAFLD. Moreover, coexisting multiple metabolic risk factors would dampen the risk of developing HCC in patients with NAFLD.

During this period, the severity of CKD was defined by eGFR and albuminuria by the organization Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO). Main risk factors for CKD such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus are closely related to lifestyle. Nutritional management is important to prevent and retard the progression of CKD. Members of the International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM) reviewed the KDOQI CPG draft. ISRNM is an international scientific society comprising members of multiple subspecialties. ISRNM proposed the medical term protein-energy wasting (PEW), which is a keyword in renal nutrition. The prevalence of PEW among dialysis patients is high. The success of dietary therapy depends on adherence to the diet. It has to be palatable, otherwise eating habits will not change. To prevent the development and progression of CKD and PEW, regular consultation with an expert dietitian is required, especially regarding salt and protein restriction. Our cluster-randomized trial showed that intervention by a dietician was effective at retarding the progression of stage 3 CKD. In this review, I focus on salt (sodium) restriction and introduce tips for salt restriction and Japanese kidney-friendly recipes. Due to the lack of randomized controlled trials, nutritional management of CKD inevitably relies on expert opinion. In this regard, well-designed observational studies are needed.

Clarifying what type of renal artery problem (dynamic obstructive renal artery, DORA, or static obstructive renal artery, SORA) secondary to STAAD benefits from true lumen opening is helpful in providing a reference for the indication of renal artery intervention. METHODS: From May 2018 to December 2019, 292 acute STAAD patients who underwent aortic surgery were enrolled in this study. DORA, SORA, and renal malperfusion were diagnosed according to preoperative aortic enhanced computed tomography (CTA). Renal artery problems secondary to STAAD were divided into three types: type 1, normal renal artery; type 2, DORA; and type 3, SORA. Acute kidney injury was divided into three stages: Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3, according to 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO). The primary endpoint was all-cause 30-day in-hospital death, and the secondary endpoint was postoperative dialysis requirement. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the difference among the three types. RESULTS: Postoperative AKI occurred in 154 of 292 (52.7%) patients, and postoperative dialysis was present in 27 of 292 (9.2%) patients with STAAD. Postoperative AKI and dialysis were significantly more prevalent in the SORA group (AKI: 71% in SORA group vs 51.5% in DORA group vs 22.2% in normal group; postoperative dialysis: 22.2% in SORA group vs 5.4% in DORA group vs 6.1 in normal group). Thirty-day (30-day) mortality was also significantly higher in the SORA group (Log-rank test, p=0.012). Preoperative acute myocardial infarction and body mass index were the independent risk factors for 30-day mortality. Static obstructive renal artery, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and renal blood cell transfusion >3 units were the independent risk factors for postoperative dialysis requirement. CONCLUSION: Static obstructive renal artery led to higher 30-day in-hospital mortality and more postoperative dialysis. Open surgery reduced renal ischaemia injury caused by DORA, but it could not reduce renal ischaemia injury caused by SORA.",2022/01/26 06:00,S1443-9506(21)01345-7 [pii] and 10.1016/j.hlc.2021.11.002 [doi],35074261,100963739,Australia,S1443-9506(21)01345-7 [pii] and 10.1016/j.hlc.2021.11.002 [doi],Dynamic obstruction and Postoperative acute kidney injury and Renal artery problems and Stanford type A aortic dissection and Static obstruction,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20220121,Copyright Â© 2021.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: The inclusion and outcomes of participants in the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial, which randomized individuals with type 2 diabetes and CKD to canagliflozin or placebo, were evaluated after calculating eGFR using the 2009 CKD-EPI creatinine equation with and without a race-specific coefficient or the 2021 CKD-EPI creatinine equation. Treatment effects were estimated using proportional hazards models and piecewise linear mixed effects models for eGFR slope. RESULTS: Of 4401 randomized participants, 2931 (67%) were White participants, 224 (5%) were Black participants, 877 (20%) were Asian participants, and 369 (8%) participants were other race. Among randomized participants, recalculation of screening eGFR using the 2009 equation without a race-specific coefficient had no effect on the likelihood of non-Black participants meeting inclusion criteria but would have excluded 22 (10%) randomized Black participants for eGFR<30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Recalculation with the 2021 equation would have excluded eight (4%) Black participants for low eGFR and one (0.4%) Black participant for eGFRâ‰¥90 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), whereas 30 (0.7%) and 300 (7%) non-Black participants would have been excluded for low and high eGFR, respectively. A high proportion (eight of 22; 36%) of end points in Black participants occurred in individuals who would have been excluded following recalculation using the race-free 2009 equation but not when recalculated with the 2021 equation (one of eight; 13%). Cardiovascular and kidney treatment effects remained consistent across eGFR categories following recalculation with either equation. Changes in estimated treatment effects on eGFR slope were modest but were qualitatively larger following recalculation using the 2021 equation. However, the effect of canagliflozin on chronic change in eGFR was attenuated by 7% among Black participants and increased 6% in non-Black participants. CONCLUSIONS: In the CREDENCE trial, eGFR recalculation without the race-specific coefficient had small but potentially important effects on event rates and the relative proportion of Black participants without substantially changing efficacy estimates.Clinical Trial registry name and registration number: Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE), NCT02065791.",2022/01/23 06:00,CJN.08980621 [pii] and 10.2215/CJN.08980621 [doi],35063969,101271570,United States,CJN.08980621 [pii] and 10.2215/CJN.08980621 [doi],canagliflozin and chronic kidney disease and clinical trial and diabetes mellitus and disparity and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and race,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20220121,Copyright Â© 2022 by the American Society of Nephrology.,NA,NA,CREDENCE study investigators,NA,NA,NA,NA,ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT02065791,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The subjective symptom burden often correlates poorly with the underlying disease severity, and patients' needs for effective treatment are far from being met. Initial evidence indicates that, in addition to disease-specific pathophysiological processes, psychological factors such as expectations, somatosensory amplification and prior illness experiences contribute to symptom persistence in functional as well as in somatic diseases. However, prospective studies investigating the transition from acute to chronic somatic symptoms, integrating pathophysiological, psychological and social factors, are scarce. A better understanding of the multifactorial mechanisms of symptom persistence is crucial for developing targeted mechanism-based interventions for effective prevention and treatment of PSS. Thus, the overall aim of the interdisciplinary SOMACROSS research unit is to identify generic and disease-specific risk factors and aetiological mechanisms of symptom persistence across a range of diseases. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Seven projects will investigate risk factors and mechanisms of symptom persistence in a total of 3916 patients across 10 medical conditions. All study designs are prospective and share common assessment points, core instruments and outcome variables to allow comparison and validation of results across projects and conditions. Research will focus on the identification of generic and disease-specific mechanisms associated with unfavourable symptom course. The development of a multivariate prediction model will facilitate the understanding of the course of PSS across diseases. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: All individual SOMACROSS studies were approved by the ethics committees of the Medical Chambers Hamburg and MÃ¼nster, Germany. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, scientific conferences and the involvement of relevant stakeholders, patients and the lay public. This interdisciplinary research unit will fundamentally contribute to earlier recognition of patients at risk, and to the development of prevention and tailored treatment concepts for PSS.",2022/01/23 06:00,bmjopen-2021-057596 [pii] and 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-057596 [doi],35063961,101552874,NA,10.1136/bmjopen-2021-057596 [doi] and e057596,adult dermatology and adult psychiatry and chronic renal failure and functional bowel disorders and gastroenterology and hepatology,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,PMC8785206,NA,Competing interests: None declared.,20220121,Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

We evaluated the outcome of dialysis therapy in older patients with HF and advanced CKD. METHODS: We examined adults aged â‰¥70 years with HF and eGFR â‰¤20 ml/min/1.73 m2 between 2008-2012 and no prior renal replacement therapy, cancer, cirrhosis or organ transplant. We identified patients who initiated chronic dialysis through 2013 and matched patients who did not initiate dialysis on age, gender, diabetes status, being alive on dialysis initiation date, and a high-dimensional propensity score for starting dialysis. Deaths were identified through 2013. We used Cox regression to evaluate the association of chronic dialysis and all-cause death. RESULTS: Among 348 adults with HF and advanced CKD who initiated dialysis and 947 matched patients who did not start dialysis, mean age was 80Â±5 years, 51% were women and 33% were Black. The crude rate of death was high overall but lower in those initiating vs. not initiating chronic dialysis (26.1 vs. 32.1 per 100 person-years, respectively, P = 0.02). In multivariable analysis, dialysis was associated with a 33% (95% Confidence Interval:17-46%) lower adjusted rate of death compared with not initiating dialysis.

This review article is focused on recent advances in the mechanism, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of hantavirus induced HFRS. The importance of interactions between viral and host factors in the design of therapeutic strategies is discussed. Hantavirus induced HFRS is characterized by thrombocytopenia and proteinuria of varying severities. The mechanism of kidney injury appears immunopathological with characteristic deterioration of endothelial cell function and compromised barrier functions of the vasculature. Although multidisciplinary research efforts have provided insights about the loss of cellular contact in the endothelium leading to increased permeability, the details of the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. The epidemiology of hantavirus induced renal failure is associated with viral species and the geographical location of the natural host of the virus. The development of vaccine and antiviral therapeutics is necessary to avoid potentially severe outbreaks of this zoonotic illness in the future. The recent groundbreaking approach to the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine has revolutionized the general field of vaccinology and has provided new directions for the use of this promising platform for widespread vaccine development, including the development of hantavirus mRNA vaccine.

The prognosis of asymptomatic AF is at least similar or worse than symptomatic AF, but there are no such data from Middle East patients with AF. The Gulf-SAFE (Gulf Survey of Atrial Fibrillation Events) registry is a multicenter prospective survey of patients presenting with AF to participate medical institutions in 6 countries in the Gulf region. We investigated the prognostic outcomes of patients with asymptomatic AF in relation to clinical subtypes. A total of 2043 patients with AF were included; 541 were identified as having asymptomatic AF (26.5%) who tended to be older, with higher prevalences of hypertension, heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes, stroke, renal dysfunction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and had higher Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age â‰¥75, Stroke (2 points), Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age â‰¥75 (2 points), Diabetes, Stroke (2 points), Vascular disease, Age 65-74, Sex category (CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc), and Hypertension, Age â‰¥65, Stroke, Bleeding history, liable INR, Elderly, Drug or alcohol use (HAS-BLED) scores (all p <0.05).

The increased risk of stroke/SE in asymptomatic AF was more prominent among paroxysmal AF subtype (p for interactionÂ =Â 0.028). In conclusion, in the Gulf-SAFE registry, patients with asymptomatic AF represent a nonbenign entity with worse outcomes compared with symptomatic AF.

Virtually all of these RCTs were enacted on the premise that 'more' haemodialysis might improve clinical outcomes compared to 'conventional' haemodialysis. Aim of the present narrative review was to analyse these landmark RCTs by posing the following question: were their intervention strategies (i.e., earlier dialysis start, higher haemodialysis dose, intensive haemodialysis, increase in convective transport, starting haemodialysis with three sessions per week) able to improve clinical outcomes? The answer is no. There are at least two main reasons why many RCTs have failed to demonstrate the expected benefits thus far: (1) in general, RCTs included relatively small cohorts and short follow-ups, thus producing low event rates and limited statistical power; (2) the designs of these studies did not take into account that ESKD does not result from a single disease entity: it is a collection of different diseases and subtypes of kidney dysfunction. Patients with advanced kidney failure requiring dialysis treatment differ on a multitude of levels including residual kidney function, biochemical parameters (e.g., acid base balance, serum electrolytes, mineral and bone disorder), and volume overload. In conclusion, the different intervention strategies of the RCTs herein reviewed were not able to improve clinical outcomes of ESKD patients. Higher quality studies are needed to guide patients and clinicians in the decision-making process. Future RCTs should account for the heterogeneity of patients when considering inclusion/exclusion criteria and study design, and should a priori consider subgroup analyses to highlight specific subgroups that can benefit most from a particular intervention.",2022/01/19 06:00,10.1007/s40620-022-01246-8 [pii] and 10.1007/s40620-022-01246-8 [doi],35041196,9012268,Italy,10.1007/s40620-022-01246-8 [doi],End-stage kidney disease and Haemodialysis and Mortality and Randomized controlled trials and Survival,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20220118,Â© 2022.

The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of post-discharge hypertension and albuminuria using reference-standard measurements in children admitted to the PICU, and evaluate their association with AKI. METHODS: Single-center longitudinal cohort study of children admitted to the PICU from 2005 to 2010 with 7-8Â years of follow-up (nâ€‰=â€‰207). Patients were excluded if they had pre-existing chronic kidney disease, were deceased, livedâ€‰>â€‰3.5-h drive away, were unwilling/unable to provide consent/assent, or had a clotting disorder. AKI was defined by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes creatinine definition. Office blood pressure was evaluated using age, sex, and height-based percentiles. Hypertension was defined using 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Albuminuria was defined as first morning urine albumin:creatinine ratioâ€‰â‰¥â€‰30Â mg/g. Prevalence of blood pressure outcomes was calculated. The association between AKI and outcomes was evaluated using multivariable regression. RESULTS: Sixty of 207 (29%) children developed AKI during PICU admission. Overall, 6% had albuminuria and 21% had elevated office blood pressure or worse. One-hundred-and-seventy-seven (86%) patients had successful ABPM data. Of these, 10 (6%) had white coat, 18 (10%) had masked, and 5 (3%) had ambulatory hypertension. There was no statistically significant difference in outcomes across AKI stages. CONCLUSIONS: Blood pressure abnormalities are common in children 7Â years after PICU admission.

RESULTS: Admission files of 490 patients were reviewed. Median age was 74 years; patients presented numerous conditions associated to age, namely hypertension, diabetes or anemia. Hospital mortality rate was associated to pulmonary heart disease, respiratory conditions and kidney disease. Most of the files analyzed corresponded to inpatient admissions; hospital incidence decreased over the study period in patients over 60 years.

This observational cohort study aimed to estimate (1) the point prevalence of AS and AVR at dialysis start and (2) the AS incidence and associated factors prospective to dialysis initiation. The study included 14,550 patients initiating dialysis registered in the Swedish Renal Registry between 2005 and 2018. AS was defined by the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes, and AVR by the surgical procedure codes. Associations between covariates and outcomes were assessed in Cox regression models. The median age was 68 (57 to 77), 66% were males, and the point prevalence of AS and AVR was 3.4% and 1.1%, respectively. In those without known AS/AVR at dialysis initiation (nÂ =Â 14,050), AS was diagnosed in 595 patients (incidence 16.3/1000 person-years, 95% confidence interval [CI] 15.1 to 17.7/1,000 person-years) during a median follow-up of 2.7 years (interquartile range 1.1 to 5.7). In adjusted Cox regression models, higher age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.03, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.04), male gender (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.83), atrial fibrillation (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.64), and hypertension (HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.65) were associated with incident AS. Peritoneal dialysis patients had a nonsignificant trend toward higher AS risk compared with hemodialysis (HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.40). About 20% of patients (nÂ =Â 113) diagnosed with incident AS underwent AVR (incidence 3.1/1000 person-years, 95% CI 2.6 to 3.7/1,000). Only the male gender was associated with AVR (HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.30 to 3.30). In conclusion, the prevalence and incidence of AS and AVR in patients initiating dialysis are high.

We aimed to identify genetic loci associated with serum T(50) and study their association with cardiovascular disease and mortality. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study of serum T(50) in 2,739 individuals of European descent participating in the Prevention of REnal and Vascular ENd-stage Disease (PREVEND) study, followed by a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to examine causal effects of T(50) on cardiovascular outcomes. Finally, we examined associations between T(50) loci and cardiovascular outcomes in 8,566 community-dwelling participants in the Rotterdam study. RESULTS: We identified three independent genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in the AHSG gene encoding fetuin-A: rs4917 (p = 1.72 Ã— 10(-101)), rs2077119 (p = 3.34 Ã— 10(-18)), and rs9870756 (p = 3.10 Ã— 10(-8)), together explaining 18.3% of variation in serum T(50). MR did not demonstrate a causal effect of T(50) on cardiovascular outcomes in the general population. Patient-level analyses revealed that the minor allele of rs9870756, which explained 9.1% of variation in T(50), was associated with a primary composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular disease [odds ratio (95% CI) 1.14 (1.01-1.28)] and all-cause mortality alone [1.14 (1.00-1.31)]. The other variants were not associated with clinical outcomes. In patients with type 2 diabetes or chronic kidney disease, the association between rs9870756 and the primary composite endpoint was stronger [OR 1.40 (1.06-1.84), relative excess risk due to interaction 0.54 (0.01-1.08)]. CONCLUSIONS: We identified three SNPs in the AHSG gene that explained 18.3% of variability in serum T(50) levels.

Snake venoms cause a variety of potentially fatal clinical toxin syndromes, including venom-induced consumption coagulopathy (VICC) which is associated with major haemorrhage. A subset of patients with VICC develop a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). This article reviews recent evidence regarding snakebite-associated TMA and its epidemiology, diagnosis, outcomes, and effectiveness of interventions including antivenom and therapeutic plasma-exchange. Snakebite-associated TMA presents with microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (evidenced by schistocytes on the blood film), thrombocytopenia in almost all cases, and a spectrum of acute kidney injury (AKI). A proportion of patients require dialysis, most survive and achieve dialysis free survival. There is no evidence that antivenom prevents TMA specifically, but early antivenom remains the mainstay of treatment for snake envenoming. There is no evidence for therapeutic plasma-exchange being effective. We propose diagnostic criteria for snakebite-associated TMA as anaemia with >1.0% schistocytes on blood film examination, together with absolute thrombocytopenia (<150 Ã— 10(9)/L) or a relative decrease in platelet count of >25% from baseline.

1,e0261958,"INTRODUCTION: Multicenter studies involving patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with the disease caused by the new coronavirus (COVID-19) and treated with renal replacement therapy (RRT) in developing countries are scarce. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the demographic profile, clinical picture, risk factors for mortality, and outcomes of critically ill patients with AKI requiring dialysis (AKI-RRT) and with COVID-19 in the megalopolis of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective, observational study was conducted in the intensive care units of 13 public and private hospitals in the metropolitan region of the municipality of SÃ£o Paulo. Patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit, aged â‰¥ 18 years, and treated with RRT due to COVID-19-associated AKI were included. RESULTS: The study group consisted of 375 patients (age 64.1 years, 68.8% male). Most (62.1%) had two or more comorbidities: 68.8%, arterial hypertension; 45.3%, diabetes; 36.3%, anemia; 30.9%, obesity; 18.7%, chronic kidney disease; 15.7%, coronary artery disease; 10.4%, heart failure; and 8.5%, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Death occurred in 72.5% of the study population (272 patients). Among the 103 survivors, 22.3% (23 patients) were discharged on RRT. In a multiple regression analysis, the independent factors associated with death were the number of organ dysfunctions at admission and RRT efficiency. CONCLUSION: AKI-RRT associated with COVID-19 occurred in patients with an elevated burden of comorbidities and was associated with high mortality (72.5%). The number of organ dysfunctions during hospitalization and RRT efficiency were independent factors associated with mortality.

Sarcopenia, when ascertained by radiological measures, is associated with a higher transplant waiting list mortality; but studies on post-operative outcomes are lacking. We aimed to determine the clinical significance of low muscle mass in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients subsequently receiving KT. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 63 patients with Stage 4-5 CKD who, between 2012 and 2020, had undergone abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning up to 2Â years before KT. The degree of skeletal muscle loss was assessed using the total cross-sectional skeletal muscle area at the third lumbar vertebral level (L3). Cox proportional-hazards regression and Frailty models were used to identify risk factors for early hospital readmission post KT. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients (54%) displayed low muscle mass, which was independently associated with a lower serum creatinine and phosphate, lower body mass index, lower mean muscle attenuation of the L3 cross-sectional area, and higher serum parathyroid hormone (for all pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Deceased donor transplant recipients (nâ€‰=â€‰45) with low muscle mass demonstrated greater hospital readmissions within 30Â days of KT [adjusted hazard ratio (HR)â€‰=â€‰4.24, 95% CI 1.40-12.90, pâ€‰=â€‰0.01].

Segmental ureterectomy (SU) has been proposed as an alternative to radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) for selected upper tract urothelial carcinomas (UTUC), to reduce post-operative morbidity, and preserve renal function. The aim of this study was to compare RNU and SU in terms of post-operative complications, functional outcomes, and overall survival (OS) in older patients treated for UTUC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of patients aged 75 years or older and treated for UTUC were included. The primary outcome was to compare RNU versus SU according to post-operative complications, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) variation, and OS. Complications were defined according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. eGFR was calculated according to the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula. Un-adjusted OS curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Overall, 177 patients (150 RNU and 27 SU) were eligible for the analysis. Pre- and post-operative characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. RNU patients showed higher incidence of post-operative complications (34.0% vs. 7.4%, PÂ =Â .011). The mean post-operative serum creatinine was lower in SU patients in comparison with the RNU ones (1.23 vs. 1.69 mg/dL, PÂ =Â .046), but no differences were found in terms of eGFR variation (PÂ =Â .258). At 3 years of follow-up, the OS was comparable between the two surgical techniques (PÂ =Â .129). CONCLUSION: In older patients diagnosed with UTUC, SU could offer lower rates of post-operative complications without affecting survival.",2022/02/08 06:00,S1558-7673(22)00018-0 [pii] and 10.1016/j.clgc.2022.01.007 [doi],35125302,101260955,United States,S1558-7673(22)00018-0 [pii] and 10.1016/j.clgc.2022.01.007 [doi],Aged and Kidney sparing surgery and Postoperative complications and Renal function and Survival,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20220113,Copyright Â© 2022.

Our study explores the relationship between MAFLD and CKD using Transient Elastography (TE) with a Controlled Attenuated Parameter (CAP). Methods: We evaluated 335 patients with diabetes with MAFLD and with high CKD risk using TE with CAP (FibroScanÂ®). The CKD was defined according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2012 guidelines. Logistic regression and stepwise multiple logistic regression were used to evaluate the factors associated with CKD. In addition, a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to assess the performance of CAP and TE in predicting CKD and its optimal threshold. Results: The prevalence of CKD in our group was 60.8%. Patients with CKD had higher mean liver stiffness measurements (LSM) and CAP values than those without CKD. We found that hepatic steatosis was a better predictor of CKD than fibrosis. Univariate regression showed that CAP values >353 dB/m were predictive of CKD; while the multivariate regression analysis (after adjustment according to sex, body mass index (BMI), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc), and fasting glucose) showed that CAP values >353 dB/m were more strongly associated with the presence of CKD compared to the LSM (fibrosis) values.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using Vanderbilt University Medical Center electronic health records (2006-2019), two RW cohorts of HFrEF patients were identified. The ""Clinical Cohort"" was based on a validated HFrEF algorithm and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) â‰¤40%. The ""GALACTIC-HF-like Cohort"" mirrored enrollment requirements of the GALACTIC-HF clinical trial including hospitalizations, medications, laboratory values, and LVEF â‰¤35%. RESULTS: Median age at index for the Clinical Cohort (N = 3954) and GALACTIC-HF-like Cohort (N = 1541) were 65 and 61 years, respectively; both were 67% male and 80% white. Over half had coronary artery disease (55% Clinical vs 64% GALACTIC-HF-like); hypercholesterolemia was common (69% Clinical vs 74% GALACTIC-HF-like). Chronic kidney disease (31 vs 21%), atrial fibrillation (32 vs 29%), and cardiac resynchronization or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (26 vs 23%) were higher in the GALACTIC-HF-like Cohort. ACE inhibitor use was high in both groups but more common in the GALACTIC-HF-like Cohort (71% and 82%, respectively). Beta-blockers or loop diuretics were used by >90% of both cohorts.

CONCLUSION: Approximately 40% of RW HFrEF patients met criteria for the GALACTIC-HF trial.

However, the impact of antibiotic use and risk of EOCRC is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a population-based case-control study of CRC among individuals aged â‰¥18 years in the Epidemiology Strengthened by histoPathology Reports in Sweden (ESPRESSO) cohort (2006-2016). The primary outcome was EOCRC. A secondary outcome was CRC at any age. Incident CRC was pathologically confirmed, and for each, up to 5 population-based controls were matched on age, sex, county of residence, and calendar year. We assessed prescriptions until 6 months before CRC diagnosis. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: We identified 54,804 cases of CRC (2,557 EOCRCs) and 261,089 controls. Compared with none, previous antibiotic use was not associated with EOCRC risk after adjustment for potential confounders (aOR 1.06, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.17) with similarly null findings when stratified by anatomic tumor site. In contrast, previous antibiotic use was weakly associated with elevated risk for CRC at any age (aOR 1.05, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.07). A potential but modest link between broad-spectrum antibiotic use and EOCRC was observed (aOR 1.13, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.26). DISCUSSION: We found no conclusive evidence that antibiotics are associated with EOCRC risk. Although antibiotic use was weakly associated with risk of CRC at any age, the magnitude of association was modest, and the study period was relatively short.",2022/01/15 06:00,01720094-990000000-00001 [pii] and CTG-21-0335 [pii] and 10.14309/ctg.0000000000000437 [doi],35029165,101532142,NA,10.14309/ctg.0000000000000437 [doi] and e00437,NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,PMC8806371,NA,"Guarantor of the article: Jonas Ludvigsson, MD, PhD.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: A national inpatient database of tertiary hospitals in China. PARTICIPANTS: The study included a total of 19.5 million hospitalisations of adult patients from July 2013 to June 2014. Information on CKD and other major NCDs, including coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cancer, was extracted from the unified discharge summary form. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost, length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: The percentages of hospitalisations with CKD, CHD, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, COPD and cancer were 4.5%, 9.2%, 8.2%, 18.8%, 7.9%, 2.3% and 19.4%, respectively. For each major NCD, the presence of CKD was independently associated with longer hospital stay, with increased percentages ranging from 7.69% (95% CI 7.11% to 8.28%) for stroke to 21.60% (95% CI 21.09% to 22.10%) for CHD. Hospital mortality for other NCDs was also higher in the presence of CKD, with fully adjusted relative risk ranging from 1.91 (95% CI 1.82 to 1.99) for stroke to 2.65 (95% CI 2.55 to 2.75) for cancer. Compared with other NCDs, CKD was associated with the longest hospital stay (22.1% increase) and resulted in the second highest in-hospital mortality, only lower than that of cancer (relative risk, 2.23 vs 2.87, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of diagnosed CKD alongside each major NCD was associated with an additional burden on the healthcare system.

We aimed to evaluate the attributable risk associated with mild RI for the in-hospital outcomes in patients with ACS. METHODS: The Improving Care for Cardiovascular Disease in China-ACS (CCC-ACS) Project was a collaborative study of the American Heart Association and the Chinese Society of Cardiology. A total of 92,509 inpatients with a discharge diagnosis of ACS were included. The attributable risk was calculated to investigate the effect of mild RI (eGFR 60-89 ml / min Â· 1.73 m(2)) on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) during hospitalization. RESULTS: The average age of these ACS patients was 63 years, and 73.9% were men. The proportion of patients with mild RI was 36.17%. After adjusting for other possible risk factors, mild RI was still an independent risk factor for MACEs in ACS patients. In the ACS patients, theÂ attributable risk of eGFR 60-89ml/minÂ·1.73m(2) to MACEs was 7.78%, 4.69% of eGFR 45-59 ml/minÂ·1.73m(2), 4.46% of eGFR 30-44 ml/minÂ·1.73m(2), and 3.36% of eGFR<30 ml/minÂ·1.73m(2).

However, conclusive evidence regarding their reciprocal interaction and the consequent impact on clinical events is still lacking. OBJECTIVES: We performed a metaanalysis with the aim to evaluate the prevalence of HPR in patients with and without CKD and the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) according to the renal and platelet function status in current literature (co-primary endpoints). Secondary endpoints were myocardial infarction (MI), all-cause death, and definite/probable stent thrombosis (ST). METHODS: We searched on PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library studies investigating CKD and HPR on clopidogrel in patients suffering CAD who underwent PCI and their related outcomes. Overall, 13 studies including 22.464 patients were selected. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random-effects model with the Mantel-Haenszel method. RESULTS: Patients with CKD presented significantly higher odds of HPR compared with those without CKD (OR 1.51 [95% CI: 1.29, 1.76]). In patients without CKD, HPR was associated with increased odds of MACE (OR 1.31 [95% CI: 1.01, 1.72]), MI (OR 1.48 [95% CI: 1.17, 1.86]) and definite/probable ST (OR 2.45 [95% CI: 1.08, 5.60]). In patients with CKD, HPR was associated with higher odds of both MACE (OR 1.61 [95% CI: 1.14, 2.27]) and MI (OR 1.69 [95% CI: 1.11, 2.59]), compared to those without HPR. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis shows that HPR on clopidogrel is more frequent in patients with CKD treated with PCI.

AIM: To study the prevalence, predictive factors and clinical outcomes in hospitalized cirrhotic patients with AKD. METHODS: The North American Consortium for the Study of End-Stage Liver Disease prospectively enrolled hospitalized decompensated cirrhotic patients. Patients were separated into those with normal renal function (controls or C), AKD or stage 1 AKI as their worst renal dysfunction per International Club of Ascites definition and compared. Parameters assessed included demographics, laboratory data, haemodynamics, renal and patient outcomes. RESULTS: 1244 patients with cirrhosis and ascites (C: 704 or 57%; AKD: 176 or 14%; stage 1 AKI: 364 or 29%) with similar demographics were enrolled. AKD patients had similar baseline sCr but higher hospital admission in the previous 6Â months, and higher peak sCr, compared to controls, with their peak sCr being lower than that in stage 1 AKI patients (all PÂ <Â .0001). The in-hospital and 30-day survival for AKD patients were intermediary between that for controls and stage 1 AKI patients (96% vs 91% vs 86%, PÂ <Â .0001). The strongest predictors for AKD development while in hospital were the presence of a second infection (OR: 2.44) and diabetes (OR: 1.53).

Randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) in this domain are notoriously challenging, and many clinical studies in AKI have yielded inconclusive findings. Underlying this conundrum is the inherent heterogeneity of AKI in its etiology, presentation, and course. AKI is best understood as a syndrome, and identification of AKI subphenotypes is needed to elucidate the disease's myriad etiologies and tailor effective prevention and treatment strategies. Conventional RCTs are logistically cumbersome and often feature highly selected patient populations that limit external generalizability, and thus alternative trial designs should be considered when appropriate.

Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the cardiovascular protective effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with stage 3/4 CKD with different baseline kidney function or underlying diseases. METHOD: To identify eligible trials, we systematically searched the Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane library databases from inception to April 15, 2021. The primary cardiovascular outcome was defined as a combination of cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization due to heart failure. Baseline kidney functions (stage 3a CKD: eGFR45-59mL/min per 1.73m2, stage 3b CKD: eGFR30-44mL/min per 1.73m2, stage 4 CKD: eGFR<30mL/min per 1.73m2) and underlying diseases (Type 2 diabetes, heart failure (Preserved ejection fraction or reduced ejection fraction), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) were used to stratify efficacy and safety outcomes. The results were subjected to a sensitivity analysis to ensure that they were reliable. RESULTS: In the present study, a total of eleven trials were included that involved a total of 27,823 patients with stage 3/4 CKD. The treatment and control groups contained 14,451 and 13,372 patients, respectively. In individuals with stage 3/4 CKD, SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of primary cardiovascular outcomes by 26% (HR 0.74, [95% CI 0.69-0.80], I2 = 0.00%), by 30% in patients with stage 3a CKD (HR 0.70, [95% CI 0.59-0.84], I2 = 18.70%), by 23% in patients with stage 3b CKD (HR 0.77, [95% CI 0.66-0.90], I2 = 2.12%), and by 29% in patients with stage 4 CKD (HR 0.71, [95% CI 0.53-0.96], I2 = 0.00%). The risk of primary outcomes was reduced by 29% (HR 0.71, [95% CI 0.63-0.80], I2 = 0.00%) in patients with type 2 diabetes, by 28% (HR 0.72, [95% CI 0.56-0.93], I2 = 37.23%) in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, by 21% (HR 0.79, [95% CI 0.70-0.89], I2 = 0.00%) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and by 25% (HR 0.75, [95% CI 0.64-0.88], I2 = 0.00%) in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: For stage 3/4 CKD, SGLT2 inhibitors significantly decreased the risk of primary cardiovascular outcomes, and these benefits were consistent throughout the spectrum of different kidney functions, even in stage 4 CKD. There was no evidence of increased adverse outcomes across different baseline clinical complications, such as type 2 diabetes, heart failure, or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.",2022/02/17 06:00,PONE-D-21-34044 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0261986 [doi],35020750,101285081,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0261986 [doi] and e0261986,NA,NA,IM,NLM,20220216,"*Atherosclerosis/drug therapy/metabolism and *Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/drug therapy/mortality and Female and *Heart Failure/drug therapy/mortality and Hospitalization and Humans and Male and *Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/drug therapy/mortality and Risk Factors and Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors/*therapeutic use",PMC8754287,0 (Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors),The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.,20220112,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

SETTING: China and the US. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional and prospective cohorts. PARTICIPANTS: We included 2019 participants aged 65 and above from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study (CLHLS) in 2012, and 2177 from US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 2011-2014. OUTCOMES: Urinary albumin, urinary creatinine, albumin creatinine ratio (ACR), serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, plasma albumin, uric acid, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). CKD (ACR â‰¥ 30 mg/g or eGFR< 60 ml/min/1.73m2) and mortality. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models. Covariates included age, sex, race, education, income, marital status, health condition, smoking and drinking status, physical activity and body mass index. RESULTS: Chinese participants had lower levels of urinary albumin, ACR, and uric acid than the US (mean: 25.0 vs 76.4 mg/L, 41.7 vs 85.0 mg/g, 292.9 vs 341.3 Î¼mol/L). In the fully-adjusted model, CKD was associated with the risk of mortality only in the US group (hazard ratio [HR], 95% CI: 2.179, 1.561-3.041 in NHANES, 1.091, 0.940-1.266 in CLHLS). Compared to eGFRâ‰¥90, eGFR ranged 30-44 ml/min/1.73m2 was only associated with mortality in the US population (HR, 95% CI: 2.249, 1.141-4.430), but not in the Chinese population (HR, 95% CI: 1.408, 0.884-2.241). CONCLUSIONS: The elderly participants in the US sample had worse CKD-related biomarker levels than in China sample, and the association between CKD and mortality was also stronger among the US older adults.

An integrated approach to tackle T2DM, HF, and CKD within the context of cardiorenal disease has the potential to improve outcomes and reduce costs at the system level. OBJECTIVE: To synthesize published evidence describing the burden of those diagnosed with T2DM, HF, and CKD in the United States as individual discrete chronic conditions, in order to evaluate the potential economic impact of novel therapies in this population. METHODS: We developed a compartmental Markov model with an annual time cycle to model an evolving prevalent US patient population with T2DM, HF, or CKD over the period 2021-2030 (either in isolation or combined). The model was used to explore the potential impact of novel therapies such as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors on future disease burden, by extrapolating the results of relevant clinical trials to representative patient populations. RESULTS: The model estimates that total prevalence across all disease states will have increased by 28% in 2030. Cumulatively, the direct health care cost of cardiorenal disease between 2021 and 2030 is estimated at $4.8 trillion. However, treatment with dapagliflozin has the potential to reduce disease prevalence by 8.0% and estimated cumulative service delivery costs by 3.6% by 2030. CONCLUSIONS: Considering a holistic approach when managing patients with cardiorenal disease offers an opportunity to reduce the disease burden over the next 10 years in the US population.

We conducted a literature search and retrieved a total of 23 meta-analyses and network meta-analyses for summarization. Pharmacotherapies were evaluated across six major outcomes: remission, relapse, mortality, end stage kidney disease (ESKD) progression, infection, and malignancy. RESULT: Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), particularly tacrolimus (TAC), in combination with glucocorticoids (GC) outperformed cyclophosphamide (CPA) with GC in the rate of remission, either complete or partial remission, and in terms of infectious complications. In maintenance therapy, MMF was superior to azathioprine (AZA) as the MMF-treated patients had lower relapse rate.

Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is a promising non-invasive tool to evaluate kidney fibrosis. We recently adapted diffusion-weighted imaging sequence for discrimination between the kidney cortex and medulla and found that the cortico-medullary difference in apparent diffusion coefficient (Î”ADC) correlated with histological interstitial fibrosis. Here, we assessed whether Î”ADC as measured with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is predictive of kidney function decline and dialysis initiation in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and patients with a kidney allograft in a prospective study encompassing 197 patients. We measured Î”ADC in 43 patients with CKD (estimated GFR (eGFR) 55ml/min/1.73m(2)) and 154 patients with a kidney allograft (eGFR 53ml/min/1.73m(2)). Patients underwent a kidney biopsy and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging within one week of biopsy; median follow-up of 2.2 years with measured laboratory parameters. The primary outcome was a rapid decline of kidney function (eGFR decline over 30% or dialysis initiation) during follow up. Significantly, patients with a negative Î”ADC had 5.4 times more risk of rapid decline of kidney function or dialysis (95% confidence interval: 2.29-12.58). After correction for kidney function at baseline and proteinuria, low ADC still predicted significant kidney function loss with a hazard ratio of 4.62 (95% confidence interval 1.56-13.67) independent of baseline age, sex, eGFR and proteinuria. Thus, low Î”ADC can be a predictor of kidney function decline and dialysis initiation in patients with native kidney disease or kidney allograft, independent of baseline kidney function and proteinuria.",2022/01/16 06:00,S0085-2538(21)01215-1 [pii] and 10.1016/j.kint.2021.12.014 [doi],35031327,0323470,United States,S0085-2538(21)01215-1 [pii] and 10.1016/j.kint.2021.12.014 [doi],Chronic kidney disease and MRI and prognostic tool,NOTNLM,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20220111,Copyright Â© 2022.

Thus, recent immunosuppressive strategies are focused on regimens that can reduce or avoid exposure to calcineurin inhibitors. Herein, we carried out a small-scale pilot study to assess whether everolimus (EVR) with reduced-dose tacrolimus (Tac) is an acceptable immunosuppressive regimen for patients with de novo ABO-incompatible kidney transplant compared with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with standard-dose Tac. METHODS: This retrospective single-center cohort study included patients who underwent ABO-incompatible kidney transplant at our institution between January 2016 and December 2019. Those whose immunosuppressive regimen was changed by reasons other than rejection during the 1-year follow-up period were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 24 patients were enrolled in this study: 10 patients who received an EVR with reduced-dose Tac regimen and 14 patients who received an MMF with standard-dose Tac regimen. Tac trough levels in the EVR group were significantly lower than those in the MMF group (P < .001). No patients died or lost their grafts during the follow-up period. There were no significant differences in renal function, proteinuria, and prevalence of hyperlipidemia between the 2 groups at 1 year after transplant. There were no significant differences in the incidence of rejection (acute cellular rejection, steroid-resistant acute cellular rejection, acute antibody-mediated rejection) and infection (cytomegalovirus viremia, cytomegalovirus disease, BK viremia, BK virus nephropathy) between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Comparable with MMF with standard-dose Tac, EVR with reduced-dose Tac might be an acceptable immunosuppressive regimen for patients with de novo ABO-incompatible kidney transplant.",2022/01/16 06:00,S0041-1345(21)00902-7 [pii] and 10.1016/j.transproceed.2021.08.062 [doi],35031117,0243532,United States,S0041-1345(21)00902-7 [pii] and 10.1016/j.transproceed.2021.08.062 [doi],NA,NA,IM,NLM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20220111,Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Inc.

(Linking),NA,"BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying long-term sequelae after AKI remain unclear. Vessel instability, an early response to endothelial injury, may reflect a shared mechanism and early trigger for CKD and heart failure. METHODS: To investigate whether plasma angiopoietins, markers of vessel homeostasis, are associated with CKD progression and heart failure admissions after hospitalization in patients with and without AKI, we conducted a prospective cohort study to analyze the balance between angiopoietin-1 (Angpt-1), which maintains vessel stability, and angiopoietin-2 (Angpt-2), which increases vessel destabilization. Three months after discharge, we evaluated the associations between angiopoietins and development of the primary outcomes of CKD progression and heart failure and the secondary outcome of all-cause mortality 3 months after discharge or later. RESULTS: Median age for the 1503 participants was 65.8 years; 746 (50%) had AKI. Compared with the lowest quartile, the highest quartile of the Angpt-1:Angpt-2 ratio was associated with 72% lower risk of CKD progression (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15 to 0.51), 94% lower risk of heart failure (aHR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.15), and 82% lower risk of mortality (aHR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.35) for those with AKI. Among those without AKI, the highest quartile of Angpt-1:Angpt-2 ratio was associated with 71% lower risk of heart failure (aHR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.69) and 68% less mortality (aHR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.68). There were no associations with CKD progression.

METHODS: Cross-sectional sample of adults on renal replacement therapy completed PROMIS-SD CAT, Insomnia Severity Index, General Anxiety Disorder-7, Edmonton Symptom Assessment System-revised Renal, SF-12 questionnaires. Construct validity was confirmed by associations with legacy instrument scores and measures of emotional wellbeing. Test-retest and scale reliability were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient and standard errors of measurement, respectively. Discrimination was assessed using receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: Among 217 participants (133 kidney transplant recipients, 84 on dialysis), 15% had moderate/severe sleep disturbance (Insomnia Severity Index â‰¥15). PROMIS-SD CAT exhibited good test-retest (intraclass correlation coefficientÂ =Â 0.89, 95% confidence interval (0.83-0.93)) and scale (>0.9 for T-scores 34-73) reliability.

In this study, we sought to identify predictors of cardio-kidney events, cardio-kidney complications, and treatment failure (i.e., addition/initiation of a new T2D class, insulin, or discontinuation of SGLT2is) after new initiation of SGLT2is in patients with CKD and T2D (DKD). METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we identified adult patients with DKD who initiated SGLT2is between April 1, 2012, and June 30, 2019, in Optum claims data. Outcome rates per 1000 person-years (PY) are reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Cox proportional hazards regression identified patient characteristics associated with each outcome. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 6389 initiators of SGLT2is. The rate of CV hospitalization was 26.0 (95% CI 21.6, 30.4) per 1000 PY. Baseline characteristics associated with higher risk of CV hospitalization included age, atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and cancer. The rate of kidney hospitalization was 12.0 (95% CI 9.0, 15.0) per 1000 PY. The risk increased significantly with baseline evidence of heart failure, hyperkalemia, respiratory failure, depression, and use of loop diuretics. In total, 55.0% of all SGLT2i initiators discontinued treatment during the follow-up period. The rate of treatment failure was 510.5 (95% CI 492.9, 528.1) per 1000 PY. Analysis of key time-dependent SGLT2i-associated adverse events showed that experiencing diabetic ketoacidosis and volume depletion were associated with risk of treatment failure. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated high rates of residual cardio-kidney outcomes and treatment failure in patients with DKD treated with SGLT2is. Patients with high baseline CV risk and the presence of certain conditions, such as atrial fibrillation, PVD, and heart failure, were at higher risk for cardio-kidney events.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with ASCVD, yet the independent role of atherogenic lipoproteins is contentious. Four groups were created based upon high and low levels of ApoB and LDL-C. Continuous and categorical variables were compared across groups, as were adjusted markers of CKD. Logistic regression analysis assessed association(s) with CKD based on the groups. Subjects were categorised by LDL-C and ApoB, using cut-off values of >160 mg/dL and >130 mg/dL, respectively.

There are limited data and controversies regarding the relationship between vitamin D (Vit D) status and COVID-19 disease. Thus, this study was designed to investigate the association between Vit D levels and the severity or outcomes of COVID-19 disease. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted in the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia from January to August 2021. All the admitted patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection were distributed into three groups depending on their Vit D levels: normal, insufficiency, and deficiency. For the three groups, demographic data, and laboratory investigations as well as data regarding the severity of COVID-19 were collected and analysed. RESULTS: A total of 203 diagnosed cases of COVID-19 were included in this study. The Vit D level was normal (>30) in 31 (15.3%) cases, insufficient in 45 (22.2%) cases and deficient in 127 (62.6%) cases. Among the included cases, 58 (28.6%) were critical cases, 109 (53.7%) were severe and 36 (17.7%) had a mild-moderate COVID-19 infection. The most prevalent comorbidity of patients was diabetes mellitus 117 (57.6%), followed by hypertension 70 (34.5%), cardiac disease 24 (11.8%), chronic kidney disease 19 (9.4%) and chronic respiratory disease in 17 (8.4%) cases. Importantly, the current study did not detect any significant association between Vit D status and COVID-19 severity (p-value=0.371) or outcomes (hospital stay, intensive care units admission, ventilation, and mortality rate) (p-value > 0.05), even after adjusting the statistical model for the confounders.

Their effects on L-arginine (Arg) related risk markers asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA and SDMA) and the protective biomarker L-homoarginine (hArg) linking T2D to cardiovascular and renal disease have not yet been reported. METHODS: Plasma and 24-h urine samples taken before and after 6Â weeks of treatment were available from two prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trials with empagliflozin (71 patients analyzed, NCT02471963) and dapagliflozin (59 patients analyzed, NCT02383238). In these samples, concentrations of hArg, Arg, ADMA, SDMA, and creatinine were determined by liquid-chromatography coupled to tandem mass-spectrometry. Additionally, intraindividual changes of the biomarkers in plasma were correlated with intraindividual changes of clinical parameters. RESULTS: Treatment with empagliflozin and dapagliflozin was associated with a reduction of plasma hArg by 17.5% and 13.7% (both pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), respectively, and increase in plasma SDMA concentration of 6.7% and 3.6%, respectively (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001 and pâ€‰<â€‰0.05), while plasma Arg and ADMA concentrations were not significantly altered. 24-h urinary excretion of ADMA was reduced by 15.2% after treatment with empagliflozin (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) but not after dapagliflozin treatment, while excretion of the other markers was not significantly altered. Renal clearance of SDMA was reduced by 9.1% and 3.9% for both drugs (both pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). A reduction in ADMA clearance was observable after empagliflozin treatment only (-â€‰15.5%, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), but not after dapagliflozin. Renal clearance of hArg and Arg was not significantly altered. Treatment effects on L-arginine related biomarkers were not constantly correlated with effects on glycated hemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose, body mass index, and systolic blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors has divergent effects on Arg-related biomarkers and could affect risk estimates associated with these markers. The observed effects are unlikely to explain the known cardiovascular and renal benefits of treatment with empagliflozin or dapagliflozin but still may indicate new therapeutic approaches in patients treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors.

Because of this, vaccination of these groups of patients against SARS-CoV-2 is particularly important. However, immune responses may be impaired in immunosuppressed and chronically ill patients. Here, our aim was to compare the efficacy of an mRNA-based vaccine in HDP, KTR, and healthy subjects. DESIGN: In this prospective observational cohort study, the humoral and cellular response of prevalent 192 HDP, 50 KTR, and 28 healthy controls (HC) was assessed 1, 2, and 6 months after the first immunization with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. RESULTS: After 6 months, 97.5% of HDP, 37.9% of KTR, and 100% of HC had an antibody response. Median antibody levels were 1539.7 (Â±3355.8), 178.5 (Â±369.5), and 2657.8 (Â±2965.8) AU/mL in HDP, KTR, and HC, respectively (p â‰¤ 0.05).

METHODS: A total of 452 patients with type 2 diabetes were included, and a cross-sectionalÂ analysis was performed. Urine albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were used to diagnose persistent albuminuria and stage chronic kidney disease, respectively. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guideline was used to describe the risk of DKD progression (low, moderate, and high or very high risks). RESULTS: The DKD group had higher levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and lower levels of free triiodothyronine (FT(3)) and free thyroxine (FT(4)) than the non-DKD group. The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in the DKD group was significantly higher than in the non-DKD group, especially the prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism. FT(3) levels decreased gradually with the deterioration of DKD. TSH levels increased with an increasing KDIGO category. FT(3) and FT(4) levels were negatively correlated with serum creatinine levels and ACR, and positively correlated with eGFR. Contrastingly, TSH was positively correlated with ACR, and negatively correlated with eGFR. After adjustment, an increase in FT(3) levels significantly reduced the risk of DKD [odds ratio, OR (95% confidence interval, CI)=0.58 (0.42-0.79)] and DKD progression [ORs (95% CIs)=0.65 (0.45-0.93) for the moderate risk group and 0.50 (0.33-0.74) for the high or very high-risk group, using the low-risk group as a reference]. FT(3) levels below 4.30 pmol/L in men and 3.99 pmol/L in women were the cut-off points for an increased risk of DKD progression. CONCLUSION: Low FT(3) level is an independent risk factor for DKD and DKD progression. FT(3) â‰¤4.30 pmol/L in men and â‰¤3.99 pmol/L in women will greatly increase the risk of kidney disease progression in patients with type 2 diabetes.",2022/01/14 06:01,347862 [pii] and 10.2147/DMSO.S347862 [doi],35023940,101515585,NA,10.2147/DMSO.S347862 [doi],prognosis of chronic kidney disease and thyroid hormone and type 2 diabetes mellitus,NOTNLM,NA,NLM,NA,NA,PMC8743497,NA,The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest for this work.,20220105,Â© 2022 Yang et al.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Moreover, defective glucose metabolism and metabolic reprogramming have been reported in distinct ADPKD models highlighting these pathways as potential therapeutic targets in ADPKD. Several ""metabolic"" approaches are currently under evaluation in adults, including ketogenic diet, food restriction, and metformin therapy.

METHODS: This study included patients 18 years or older who were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with at least 2 visits to an HIV primary care clinic in the past year. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients with an undetectable viral load (a blood HIV RNA level of <20 copies/mL) among groups of patients with 0, 1 or 2, 3 or 4, and 5 comorbidities, respectively. The secondary outcome was the percentage of patients with undetectable viral loads per each comorbidity, as listed above. The study was reviewed by an institutional review board and approved as exempt from full review. RESULTS: Among the 1,144 patients (median age of 52 years, 43% female, 74% Black) included in the study, 80% had an undetectable viral load, and the mean CD4 count was 638 cells/mm3. The majority of patients (48%) had 1 or 2 comorbidities, with only 2 patients having 5 comorbidities. For patients with 0, 1 or 2, 3 or 4, and 5 comorbidities, the percentages of patients with undetectable HIV viral loads were 76%, 81.7%, 87.9%, and 100%, respectively (P = 0.0009 in Ï‡â€Š2 test for trend). When looking at individual comorbidities, corresponding viral suppression rates were as follows: chronic kidney disease, 88.6%; hypertension, 85.8%; type 2 diabetes, 85.7%; clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 83.1%; substance abuse, 76%; and psychiatric disorders, 75.2%.

There is still an unmet need to identify patients who are unlikely to benefit from an ICD. We determined cause-specific 1-year mortality after ICD implantation and identified associated risk factors. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using Danish nationwide registries (2000-2017), we identified 14Â 516 patients undergoing first-time ICD implantation for primary or secondary prevention. Risk factors associated with 1-year mortality were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. The median age was 66 years, 81.3% were male, and 50.3% received an ICD for secondary prevention. The 1-year mortality rate was 4.8% (694/14Â 516). ICD recipients who died within 1 year were older and more comorbid compared to those who survived (72 vs. 66 years, P < 0.001). Risk factors associated with increased 1-year mortality included dialysis [odds ratio (OR): 3.26, confidence interval (CI): 2.37-4.49], chronic renal disease (OR: 2.14, CI: 1.66-2.76), cancer (OR: 1.51, CI: 1.15-1.99), age 70-79 years (OR: 1.65, CI: 1.36-2.01), and age â‰¥80 years (OR: 2.84, CI: 2.15-3.77). The 1-year mortality rates for the specific risk factors were: dialysis (13.8%), chronic renal disease (13.1%), cancer (8.5%), age 70-79 years (6.9%), and age â‰¥80 years (11.0%). Overall, the most common causes of mortality were related to cardiovascular diseases (62.5%), cancer (10.1%), and endocrine disorders (5.0%). However, the most common cause of death among patients with cancer was cancer-related (45.7%). CONCLUSION: Among ICD recipients, mortality rates were low and could be indicative of relevant patient selection.
